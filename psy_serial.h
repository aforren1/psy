/* psy_serial.h - v0.4 - public domain single-header serial-port library
 *
 *   REQUIRES psy_rt.h, its sibling in this collection, on the include path.
 *   This header includes it for the clock, the waits, the scheduling ladder
 *   and the deadline worker that writes the trailing edge of an async pulse.
 *   Copy TWO files, not one.
 *
 *   STATUS: IMPLEMENTED on Windows (Win32 COM API, overlapped I/O) and POSIX
 *   (Linux and macOS termios). Tested against a virtual port pair on Linux,
 *   including one reader thread plus one writer thread on a single handle
 *   under ThreadSanitizer. Windows and macOS compile clean in CI but have
 *   never run on a device: on Windows the open-time validation and the
 *   enumeration entry point run, but no byte has moved through the backend,
 *   and on macOS (IOSSIOSPEED, /dev/cu.* enumeration, the select() waits)
 *   nothing but the compiler has seen the code. No timing number in this
 *   header has been measured on a rig yet. The timing code is psy_rt.h's, so
 *   its STATUS block applies too: the real-time rungs of the worker's ladder
 *   have never been granted on any machine here.
 *
 *   v0.4, the current version, deletes this header's private timing code and
 *   depends on psy_rt.h for it:
 *     - The monotonic clock, the pulse-width wait, the break sleep, the
 *       SCHED_DEADLINE / SCHED_FIFO ladder, the sched_setattr declarations and
 *       the async-pulse worker thread are all gone from here. psys_now_us() is
 *       psyrt_now_us(), so "your timestamps and the library's share one base"
 *       is true by construction instead of by two copies of the same code
 *       agreeing. There were three such copies in this repository; the Windows
 *       spin bug that only this one had is the reason there is now one.
 *     - psys_sched_deadline is a typedef of psyrt_sched_deadline and
 *       psys_async_policy of psyrt_policy. The PSYS_ASYNC_*, PSYS_DEFAULT_RT_*
 *       and type names all still work, but the NUMERIC VALUES of the policy
 *       enum changed, because psyrt_policy has a macOS rung between DEADLINE
 *       and FIFO: recompile anything that stored those integers, do not just
 *       relink it. On macOS async_policy can now report
 *       PSYRT_POLICY_TIME_CONSTRAINT, a rung this header did not have.
 *     - Blocking psys_pulse() no longer busy-spins the whole width on Windows.
 *       It sleeps to the deadline and spins only the last
 *       PSYRT_DEFAULT_SPIN_NS, as the async worker always did.
 *     - The async worker is one psyrt_worker plus a small writer mutex that
 *       stays here, because the mutex is about the byte stream, not about the
 *       deadline. THREADING says what each one owns.
 *
 *   v0.3 was a correctness pass over the two backends nobody has run yet,
 *   plus two documentation corrections:
 *     - Windows: a failed GetOverlappedResult on a write no longer reports a
 *       driver error as a short count (which a caller retries forever); an
 *       aborted read that was neither an interrupt nor a disconnect waits out
 *       the rest of its timeout instead of returning 0; a failed
 *       SetCommTimeouts maps through the disconnect test; the worker's
 *       sub-millisecond spin now yields to a replacement pulse and to quit.
 *     - macOS: the reader and the writer wait with select(), not poll(),
 *       because Apple's poll(2) still documents that it does not support
 *       devices. Linux keeps poll(). See POSIX WAITS.
 *     - Linux: the low_latency readback resolves the device name first, so a
 *       /dev/serial/by-id/... symlink no longer leaves low_latency false.
 *     - psys_close()'s flush of a pending trailing byte is bounded by 50 ms
 *       instead of by write_timeout_ms, so a wedged device cannot hold a
 *       close open for a second, or forever under PSYS_TIMEOUT_INFINITE.
 *     - psys_open() refuses a handle that is still open instead of leaking
 *       its descriptor and its worker thread.
 *     - PSYS_API is on the definitions too, so `static` works.
 *
 *   v0.2 changed five signatures from the v0.1 specification: psys_interrupt,
 *   psys_purge, psys_send_break, psys_set_dtr and psys_set_rts return int
 *   (0 or a PSYS_ERR_* code), not bool, because they can be called from a
 *   thread that does not own the message buffer. See RETURN VALUES. It also
 *   added psys_pulse_async() and its worker thread; that worker has so far
 *   only been observed at PSYS_ASYNC_NORMAL, because the test machine grants
 *   no CAP_SYS_NICE, so the real-time rungs of its ladder are unexercised.
 *   docs/psy_serial.md holds the design rationale.
 *
 *   A small, dependency-free C library for byte I/O over serial ports:
 *   legacy RS-232, USB-CDC (Arduino, Teensy), and USB-serial bridges (FTDI,
 *   CP210x, CH340). Built for the devices found in psychophysics and
 *   neuroscience rigs:
 *
 *     - trigger boxes: Brain Products TriggerBox, BioSemi USB trigger
 *       interface, Cedrus c-pod / StimTracker, Black Box ToolKit, and DIY
 *       Arduino/Teensy boxes. Write a byte; it appears on the output lines.
 *     - response boxes: Cedrus RB-x40 (XID), PST Serial Response Box,
 *       Current Designs fORP in serial mode, DIY button boxes.
 *     - anything else that speaks bytes over a COM port.
 *
 *   Inspired by pyserial (https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) and written
 *   in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. It DEPENDS on
 *   psy_rt.h for everything about time, the way stb_truetype.h depends on
 *   stb_rect_pack.h: two files to copy, one library to use. With
 *   psy_parallel.h it shares conventions but not code.
 *
 *   Targets Windows (Win32 COM API), Linux and macOS (POSIX termios).

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Copy psy_serial.h AND psy_rt.h into your project, so that
 *   #include "psy_rt.h" resolves from wherever psy_serial.h sits. Then do
 *   this:
 *
 *       #define PSY_SERIAL_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header to create the
 *   implementation. Every other file just includes the header normally.
 *   psy_rt.h's implementation comes along with it, in that same file. Defining
 *   PSY_RT_IMPLEMENTATION there as well is fine, and so is implementing
 *   another header that needs psy_rt.h there, because psy_rt.h's
 *   implementation block guards itself and lands once. What does not work is
 *   putting PSY_RT_IMPLEMENTATION in a SECOND file: that is a second copy of
 *   psy_rt.h's code in the program, and the linker says so. One file
 *   implements everything.
 *
 *       #define PSY_SERIAL_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       #include "psy_serial.h"
 *
 *       psys_port sp = { 0 };                  // zeroed, or closed; required
 *       psys_desc desc = {                     // designated init: C99 or C++20
 *           .device = "COM3",                  // or "/dev/ttyUSB0"
 *           .baud   = 115200,                  // 0 = default (115200)
 *       };
 *       if (!psys_open(&sp, &desc)) {
 *           fprintf(stderr, "open failed: %s\n", psys_error(&sp));
 *           return 1;
 *       }
 *       psys_write_byte(&sp, 0x55);            // raise a trigger
 *       psys_pulse(&sp, 0x55, 0x00, 2000);     // 0x55, hold 2 ms, then 0x00
 *       psys_pulse_async(&sp, 0x55, 0x00, 2000); // same, without blocking
 *
 *       uint8_t buf[64];
 *       int n = psys_read(&sp, buf, (int)sizeof buf, 100, PSYS_READ_ANY);  // bytes within 100 ms
 *       int m = psys_read(&sp, buf, 6, 500, PSYS_READ_ALL);           // a 6-byte frame within 500 ms
 *       if (n < 0) fprintf(stderr, "read: %s\n", psys_strerror(n));
 *       psys_close(&sp);
 *
 *   Find a box by USB id instead of hard-coding the port name:
 *
 *       psys_port_filter f = { .vid = 0x0403, .pid = 0x6001 };   // FTDI FT232R
 *       psys_port_info info;
 *       if (psys_find_ports(&f, &info, 1) == 1)                  // exactly one match
 *           desc.device = info.name;
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A port is a full-duplex byte stream. The OS driver owns a receive buffer;
 *   bytes the device sends land there whether or not you are reading, and
 *   psys_read() drains it. Writes are handed to the driver and transmitted
 *   asynchronously; psys_drain() waits until the transmit buffer is empty.
 *
 *   RETURN VALUES AND ERRORS
 *     psys_open() is the only function that writes a message: it returns bool
 *     and fills psys_error(). Every other function returns an int, because
 *     every other function may run on a thread psys_open() knows nothing
 *     about, and two threads formatting into one 256-byte buffer is a data
 *     race under C11 whether or not anyone reads it. An int return is a count
 *     or a PSYS_LINE_* mask when > 0, "done" when 0, or one of the PSYS_ERR_*
 *     codes below when negative. The OS error number of the last failure goes
 *     to the slot that belongs to the calling role: psys_port.rd_oserr
 *     (reader), wr_oserr (writer), misc_oserr (the any-role calls).
 *     psys_strerror() names a code.
 *
 *       PSYS_ERR_IO            OS error; see rd_oserr / wr_oserr / misc_oserr
 *       PSYS_ERR_DISCONNECTED  the device went away (USB unplug); close it
 *       PSYS_ERR_CLOSED        the port is not open
 *       PSYS_ERR_INTERRUPTED   psys_interrupt() or psys_close() woke a wait
 *       PSYS_ERR_ARG           bad argument
 *
 *   READ SEMANTICS
 *     psys_read(p, buf, cap, timeout_ms, flags)
 *       flags = PSYS_READ_ANY (0): returns as soon as at least one byte is
 *       available, with everything buffered at that moment (up to `cap`).
 *       Returns 0 if nothing arrives within timeout_ms. timeout_ms = 0
 *       polls: it returns at once with whatever is buffered, possibly 0
 *       bytes. PSYS_TIMEOUT_INFINITE blocks until data, interrupt or
 *       disconnect. This covers both "poll the response box once per frame"
 *       (timeout 0) and "wait for a button press" (timeout > 0).
 *       flags = PSYS_READ_ALL: keeps reading until exactly `cap` bytes were
 *       read or timeout_ms elapsed in total; returns the count actually
 *       read. For framed protocols (a Cedrus XID key report is 6 bytes).
 *       A disconnect is an error (PSYS_ERR_DISCONNECTED), never a 0, so a
 *       listener with a long timeout cannot spin on a dead port.
 *     psys_available(p)
 *       Bytes currently buffered by the driver, without reading them.
 *
 *   WRITE SEMANTICS
 *     psys_write(p, buf, len) blocks until every byte is accepted by the
 *     driver or desc.write_timeout_ms elapses; on timeout it returns the
 *     count accepted (< len), never an error code. Accepted is not
 *     delivered: the bytes are then queued for the UART or the USB pipe.
 *
 *   TIMING (read this before you trust a serial trigger)
 *     USB-serial adds latency that the parallel port does not have.
 *       - Host to device: a USB bulk write is scheduled into the next 1 ms
 *         (full-speed) or 125 us (high-speed) frame. Expect about 1 ms onset
 *         latency with sub-millisecond jitter for a single-byte write.
 *       - Device to host (responses): the bridge chip holds received bytes
 *         until its buffer fills or a latency timer expires. FTDI parts
 *         default to 16 ms. Set desc.low_latency = true to request 1 ms; the
 *         LOW LATENCY section says what each platform can actually do.
 *     To timestamp a trigger, bracket the call:
 *         uint64_t t0 = psys_now_us();
 *         psys_write_byte(&sp, code);
 *         uint64_t t1 = psys_now_us();
 *     and record both. The physical edge lies after t0 and, on USB, after
 *     the next frame boundary following the driver's acceptance; t1 - t0 is
 *     the syscall cost (10 to 100 us). Neither is the onset; they bound it.
 *     psys_now_us() IS psyrt_now_us(), not a second clock that agrees with
 *     it, so these timestamps, psy_rt.h's deadlines and anything psy_rt.h
 *     reports are all differences of one counter.
 *     Measure the offset once with a scope and apply it.
 *     psys_pulse() widths below a few milliseconds are unreliable over USB.
 *     If the device can time the pulse itself (StimTracker, TriggerBox Plus,
 *     c-pod), prefer that and send one command instead of two.
 *
 *     PULSE WIDTH: WHO TIMES THE TRAILING EDGE
 *     psys_pulse() blocks the calling thread for the whole width and times the
 *     trailing edge on whatever thread the caller has, at whatever priority it
 *     has. It waits with psyrt_sleep_until() and PSYRT_DEFAULT_SPIN_NS, so the
 *     OS gets the bulk of the width and only the tail is spun.
 *     psys_pulse_async() returns after the onset write and has a psyrt_worker
 *     the library owns write the trailing byte at an absolute deadline taken
 *     right after that onset. That worker elevates itself up psy_rt.h's ladder
 *     (SCHED_DEADLINE, else the macOS time-constraint policy, else SCHED_FIFO,
 *     else normal; THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL on Windows) and waits the
 *     same way, so its trailing edge is MORE precise than psys_pulse's, not
 *     less, and the caller is free during the width. psys_port.async_policy
 *     says which rung it got; log it with your numbers, because they mean
 *     different things under different policies.
 *     What the wait itself is worth on your machine is psy_rt.h's WAITS
 *     section, and examples/rt_jitter.c measures it there: it sweeps spin
 *     windows and prints the wake-latency distribution of each, which is the
 *     only honest number available for the trailing edge before the transport
 *     gets involved.
 *     What neither call can do is beat the transport. Over USB-serial the
 *     jitter of an edge is bounded below by the frame period (1 ms full-speed,
 *     125 us high-speed) and above by OS scheduling plus the driver's own
 *     batching, and on Windows that upper bound is reported to be far worse
 *     than a frame. Frame quantization is the floor, not the budget. Put a
 *     scope on the line, record the distribution together with async_policy,
 *     and do not assume a number from this header.
 *
 *   THREADING
 *     One reader thread and one writer thread may use a handle at the same
 *     time (the "listener thread + trigger sender" pattern). The roles:
 *       reader:  psys_read, psys_available, psys_purge(PSYS_PURGE_RX)
 *       writer:  psys_write, psys_write_byte, psys_drain, psys_pulse,
 *                psys_send_break, psys_purge(PSYS_PURGE_TX)
 *       any:     psys_interrupt, psys_get_lines, psys_set_dtr, psys_set_rts
 *                (one call at a time, from any thread; they share misc_oserr)
 *       neither: psys_open, psys_close (only after both roles have returned)
 *     The async-pulse worker is a SECOND WRITER on the handle, so every
 *     writer-role write (psys_write, psys_write_byte, psys_pulse,
 *     psys_pulse_async's onset, and the worker's own trailing byte) is
 *     serialized under one writer mutex this header owns, and the worker
 *     reports through wr_oserr like any writer. That mutex is here rather than
 *     in psy_rt.h because psyrt_worker runs its callback with its OWN lock
 *     released, which is what lets the callback block on a stream write;
 *     serializing the stream is this header's job. Next to the mutex sits the
 *     pending trailing byte, armed with its deadline: psys_pulse_async() takes
 *     the mutex, writes the onset and arms, every user write takes the mutex
 *     and DISARMS before it writes, and the worker's callback takes the mutex
 *     and writes only what is still armed and due. So a trailing byte the
 *     worker had already dispatched when a user write got in first finds
 *     nothing armed and writes nothing, and a stale `off` can never undo a
 *     write that means "hold this". The price, which the parallel port does not
 *     pay because outb cannot block: if the worker's trailing write is stuck
 *     in the driver (a wedged device, a peer that stopped draining), a user
 *     write waits behind it for up to write_timeout_ms, and the other way
 *     round. One byte stream, one writer at a time.
 *     psys_close() stops the worker before it closes anything and has it write
 *     any pending trailing byte immediately instead of waiting out the rest of
 *     the width, so a latching box is never left holding a trigger code
 *     (psyrt_worker_stop() runs a pending job at once, with a flush flag the
 *     callback reads). That one write happens with the writer mutex held, and
 *     psys_close() joins the worker thread behind it, so "at once" is about the
 *     deadline, not about the call returning: it is bounded by a fixed 50 ms
 *     and NOT by write_timeout_ms,
 *     so a wedged device delays a close by at most that, whatever
 *     write_timeout_ms says and even at PSYS_TIMEOUT_INFINITE. A close with no
 *     pulse pending does not wait at all.
 *     psys_interrupt() is a reader-side wake and does not touch the worker.
 *     Nothing but psys_open and psys_close touches the message buffer, so the
 *     roles never race on it: psys_purge(PSYS_PURGE_RX) on the reader and
 *     psys_send_break on the writer are safe at the same time, and the
 *     shutdown recipe below can call psys_interrupt while the writer is
 *     mid-pulse.
 *     Shutdown sequence for a blocked listener: psys_interrupt(p) from the
 *     main thread, join the listener (its psys_read returned
 *     PSYS_ERR_INTERRUPTED), then psys_close(p). psys_close() also
 *     interrupts, but it cannot wait for the listener; closing a descriptor
 *     another thread is still using is undefined on POSIX.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   LOW LATENCY
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   desc.low_latency = true asks the driver for its minimum receive latency.
 *   It never fails psys_open(); psys_port.low_latency reports whether the
 *   request took effect.
 *
 *     Linux:   sets ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY via TIOCSSERIAL, then confirms the
 *              outcome by reading back the driver's latency_timer in sysfs,
 *              because cdc_acm accepts the ioctl and ignores the flag. Only
 *              ftdi_sio actually programs the timer (16 ms -> 1 ms). The same
 *              file can be set once per device by udev, which survives a
 *              re-plug and needs no privilege in the experiment:
 *                SUBSYSTEM=="usb-serial", DRIVER=="ftdi_sio", \
 *                  ATTR{latency_timer}="1"
 *     Windows: the FTDI latency timer lives in the registry per device and
 *              needs a re-plug to apply, so it cannot be set at runtime here.
 *              Set it once in Device Manager (Port Settings > Advanced >
 *              Latency Timer = 1) or through the FTDI D2XX API.
 *     macOS:   the Apple FTDI driver has no user-settable latency timer; the
 *              FTDI vendor driver reads it from its plist.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   DTR AND DEVICE RESET
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Opening a port asserts DTR and RTS on every platform (the pyserial
 *   default) and closing drops DTR. Arduino-class boards reset on a DTR
 *   edge, then spend about 2 s in the bootloader ignoring you. Options:
 *     desc.dtr_low_on_open      keep DTR low from the first moment the
 *                               library controls it, which is AFTER open().
 *                               On Linux this cannot stop a USB-serial board
 *                               from resetting: the kernel raises DTR and RTS
 *                               inside open() itself, O_NONBLOCK included, so
 *                               the edge has already happened and this option
 *                               only drops the line again afterwards. Use
 *                               keep_dtr_on_close in the session before, or
 *                               wait out the bootloader.
 *     desc.keep_dtr_on_close    leave DTR asserted after psys_close()
 *                               (clears HUPCL on POSIX), so the NEXT open
 *                               sees no edge. The reliable software fix for
 *                               "do not reset my box between sessions".
 *                               POSIX only: Windows drops DTR inside
 *                               CloseHandle and offers no way to stop it.
 *   Stale bytes the device sent before the open (its boot banner) stay in
 *   the driver buffer; call psys_purge(p, PSYS_PURGE_RX) before you start.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   DEVICE NAMES
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *     Windows: "COM3". Names above COM9 need the device-namespace prefix
 *              \\.\COM12 (spelled "\\\\.\\COM12" in C source). psys_open()
 *              adds the prefix for you when the name is a bare "COMn".
 *     Linux:   "/dev/ttyUSB0" (USB-serial bridge), "/dev/ttyACM0" (USB-CDC:
 *              Arduino, Teensy, most current trigger boxes), "/dev/ttyS0"
 *              (legacy UART). In experiment scripts prefer the stable
 *              "/dev/serial/by-id/usb-<vendor>_<product>_<serial>-if00-port0"
 *              symlinks, or psys_find_ports(); ttyUSB numbering changes
 *              between plug-ins.
 *     macOS:   "/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX" or "/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX". Use the
 *              cu.* (call-out) node, not tty.*, which blocks on carrier.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   POSIX WAITS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Every wait in this library is against a deadline on a non-blocking
 *   descriptor, but the call that does the waiting differs by platform.
 *     Linux:   poll(), on the port descriptor and the interrupt pipe.
 *     macOS:   select(). Apple's poll(2) still carries the note that it does
 *              not support devices, and a serial port is a device; pyserial
 *              uses select() on POSIX for the same reason. The cost is

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   psy_rt.h must be on the include path; nothing else is added to the build.
 *   Link -pthread on POSIX for the async-pulse worker and for psy_rt.h's
 *   scheduling calls; Windows needs no extra library for either.
 *   Define PSYS_NO_THREADS to drop the worker, and with it psys_pulse_async(),
 *   which then reports PSYS_ERR_IO. PSYS_NO_THREADS also defines
 *   PSYRT_NO_THREADS before psy_rt.h is included, so the two headers agree
 *   about whether psyrt_worker exists. The coupling has one direction only: if
 *   YOU include psy_rt.h before psy_serial.h, define both macros or neither,
 *   because by then psy_rt.h's declarations are already fixed.
 *   The Linux feature-test macro has no such ordering rule. Both headers ask
 *   for _DEFAULT_SOURCE on their first include and both stand down when any
 *   of _DEFAULT_SOURCE, _GNU_SOURCE, _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE is
 *   already set, so either include order gives the same translation unit.
 *   The one rule that remains is the usual one: an implementation file that
 *   includes OTHER system headers before these defines _DEFAULT_SOURCE
 *   itself.
 *   No other libraries on POSIX. The Windows port enumeration links setupapi
 *   and advapi32: MSVC gets both from a #pragma comment in the
 *   implementation, and CMake consumers of psy::psy already get setupapi from
 *   the target, so only a hand-written MinGW command line needs -lsetupapi
 *   (advapi32 is already a MinGW default). The implementation raises
 *   _WIN32_WINNT to 0x0600 if it is lower, for CancelIoEx. Define PSYS_API to
 *   override the default `extern` linkage. It sits on the definitions as well
 *   as the declarations, so -DPSYS_API=static gives one translation unit a
 *   private copy of the library (expect -Wunused-function for whatever that
 *   unit does not call), and a decl-spec such as __declspec(dllexport)
 *   reaches both.

/* ======================================================================= *
 *  ASYNC PULSE WORKER

 *  itself up psy_rt.h's scheduling ladder before psys_open() returns. What
 *  stays here is the part that is about the byte stream rather than about
 *  time.
 *
 *  psyrt_worker runs its callback with its OWN lock released, which is what
 *  lets that callback block in a driver write without deadlocking a submit
 *  from another thread. The price is that psy_rt.h serializes nothing for us,
 *  and this library's threading promise is that exactly one thread writes the
 *  port at a time. Hence the writer mutex below: every writer-role write, the
 *  worker's trailing byte included, holds it.
 *
 *  Next to the mutex sits the pending trailing byte, armed together with the
 *  deadline it is due at. That pair is the token the callback checks: it
 *  writes only what is still armed and due, so a byte the worker had already
 *  dispatched when a user write, a replacement pulse or a close got the mutex
 *  first is dropped instead of undoing that write. psyrt_worker_cancel()
 *  handles the ordinary case, where the job has not been dispatched yet; the
 *  token covers the window between psy_rt.h releasing its lock and the
 *  callback taking ours, which no cancel can reach.
 *
 *  Lock order is writer mutex, then psy_rt.h's lock (psys__async_submit and
 *  psys__write_cancel take both). The callback runs the other way round, but
 *  it holds nothing of psy_rt.h's when it takes ours, so the cycle does not
