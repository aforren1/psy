"""Run psy.trials and PsychoPy's TrialHandler / TrialHandlerExt on the same
condition lists and check the properties each order promises, on both.

Not part of CI: PsychoPy is a heavy install. This is the comparison
docs/psy_trials.md and the psy_trials.h STATUS block ask for.

    uv pip install ./bindings/python/psy_trials numpy psychopy
    python tests/compare/compare_trials_psychopy.py

On Windows `uv pip install psychopy` can fail building pywinhook; psychopy.data
only needs `uv pip install --no-deps psychopy` plus the few packages it
imports (see compare_stair_psychopy.py).

The two draw from different generators (PsychoPy: numpy default_rng(seed);
psy.trials: splitmix64 from the same seed), so random orders are compared by
property, not trial by trial:

  sequential   identical order to PsychoPy's, every seed
  random       each repetition is one block holding every condition once,
               blocks in repetition order (both sides)
  fullRandom   exact counts per condition (both sides); the first-slot
               frequencies are printed, not tested
  weights      TrialHandlerExt weight w_c with nReps r against psy.trials
               cond_reps = w_c * r: exact counts under fullRandom (both
               sides). The weighted SEQUENTIAL orders differ by design
               (PsychoPy runs a row's w_c copies back to back each
               repetition; psy.trials cycles the rows), which is printed as
               information.

Exits 1 when any property fails on either side.
