# psy_trials.h design

Status: **v0.2.1, implemented, 2026-10-07.** v0.2.1 adds jitter: a
duration drawn per trial, logged and replayed (see "v0.2.1: jitter in the
trial handler" and "Verification and cost (v0.2.1)"). v0.2 adds conditions files
and trial lists as tables (psy_table.h, docs/psy_table.md), order lists,
draws with replacement, subsets, blocked and alternating groups in
Latin-square order, units ("b always follows a"), first-order transition
balance, Latin squares and a rules text; every v0.1 desc behaves as in
v0.1.1, pinned by a test. "What v0.2 adds", the v0.2 Decisions, "Verification (v0.2)" and
"Cost (v0.2)" below record the design, the measurements behind it and
the verification. v0.1.1 status follows.
Registered in `CMakeLists.txt`, with `tests/adapt/psy_trials_test.c` under
ctest and two examples in CI; gcc and MSVC clean, sanitizer clean. The Python binding
`psy.trials` and the MEX function `psy_trials` exist, and
`tests/compare/compare_trials_psychopy.py` checks the binding against
PsychoPy's TrialHandler: identical sequential order, and the block
properties of the random orders over 100 seeds per design. The weighted
sequential order differs by design (PsychoPy runs a row's copies back to
back, this header cycles the rows), and the script reports that and does
not fail on it. This page records why the API looks the way it does and
what the implementation changed; the header says what it does.

## Goals

- The layer above the adaptive methods: which trial next, and what
  happened. The method headers refuse to own the trial loop (that is a
  stated non-goal in [psy_adapt.md](psy_adapt.md)), so every experiment
  writes the same shuffle, interleave and bookkeeping by hand. This header
  is that code, once.
- The method of constant stimuli as the base case, not a feature:
  conditions times repetitions in some order, with tallies per condition.
- Constrained random orders, stated as rules ("no more than three of the
  same orientation in a row", "a catch trial at most once in six"), checked
  at open so an impossible design fails before the session starts.
- Interleaved adaptive tracks with no dependency on the method headers: a
  track is an opaque pointer and an is-done callback.
- The same shape as the rest of the collection: one file, no heap, a
  caller-owned handle, a zeroed desc, `open` with the one message buffer,
  `next` / `update` / `done`, deterministic from the caller's generator, a
  history that replays.

## Non-goals

- Timing, stimuli, I/O. The header never touches a clock, a file or a
  device; `psytr_format_row` formats a line the caller writes.
- Fitting. Per-condition proportions are the estimate; the fit is offline.
- (v0.1) Counterbalancing across sessions or subjects, and transition
  balancing within a session. v0.2 reversed both at the user's request:
  Latin and Williams squares by participant number, and exact first-order
  transition balance by an Euler circuit rather than a scored repair (see
  Decisions).
- Multi-session experiment structure (PsychoPy's ExperimentHandler). One
  handle is one session; the caller strings sessions together.

## Prior art

| Feature | PsychoPy | Here |
|---|---|---|
| Conditions x reps, sequential / random / fullRandom | `TrialHandler(trialList, nReps, method)` | `psytr_desc` with the same three orders, the same block semantics (random shuffles within each repetition) |
| Weighted conditions | `TrialHandlerExt` weights | `cond_reps[]` |
| Interleaved adaptive procedures | `MultiStairHandler(method='random'/'sequential')` | tracks with random-by-weight or round-robin interleave, plus `track_rate` to mix them with scheduled trials |
| Constraints on the order | none; users post-process `sequence` or roll their own | five rules, repaired at open, unsatisfiable sets fail at open |
| Catch trials | a condition with its own weight; spacing by hand | a condition placed by `psytr_min_gap` or `psytr_max_in_window` |
| Re-running missed trials | none built in (users append to `trialList`) | `psytr_requeue` with an optional gap |
| Practice | a separate handler | `n_practice`, flagged, untallied |
| Data | `addData`, `saveAsWideText` | a fixed-size caller record per trial, `psytr_format_row`, the history array |
| Resume | `saveAsPickle` | `psytr_save` / `psytr_load` byte snapshot, or `psytr_restore` from the outcomes plus the seed (a re-queue is its own outcome value so replay can tell it from an invalid response) |

Psychtoolbox has no equivalent; labs write their own. Palamedes has none.

## What v0.2 adds

v0.2 adds what the v0.1 non-goals and the rig plan
([rig_spec.md](rig_spec.md) 14.1 and 14.5) asked for:

- Conditions files and fixed trial lists from CSV, as tables. The parser,
  the number parser and the table block are a separate header,
  psy_table.h ([psy_table.md](psy_table.md)), because the pack stores the
  same block.
- jsPsych's sample types: with replacement, a subset without replacement,
  fixed repetitions, alternating groups and an explicit order list.
- Groups of trials in an outer order, with Latin-square group orders by
  participant.
- "b always follows a" and its variants, as units.
- First-order transition balance.
- Latin and Williams squares by participant number.
- A rules text with one statement per C call or desc field.
- The Python and MEX bindings of all of it.

Every v0.1 desc gives the same schedule, draws, history, records,
tallies, format lines (but the version token) and snapshot bytes as
v0.1.1. `tests/adapt/psy_trials_pins.h` holds the hashes of 600 v0.1.1
sessions (30 designs x 20 seeds); the test checks them.

The v0.2 decisions follow the v0.1 ones under Decisions.

## Decisions

### Tracks are opaque

The header could have included the three method headers and offered
`psytr_add_stair(&s)`. It does not, for the convention's sake (a header
includes nothing but psy_rt.h, and this one includes nothing) and because
the caller has to call the track's own `next` and `update` anyway: the
sequencer cannot know the level's type. A track is `{ctx, is_done, weight}`
and the adapter is three lines. The cost is that the history records which
track a trial came from but not its level; that is what the caller record
is for, and the second USAGE example puts the level there.

### Constraints are repaired, not sampled, and then held at run time

Rejection sampling of whole orders fails silently on tight constraints and
gives no diagnosis. The repair is deterministic from the seed, terminates,
and when it fails it names the first constraint still violated, so a
contradictory design is reported at open. It is not uniform over
satisfying orders; no practical method is, and the manual says so. The
five rules cover the constraints seen in practice: run length, density in
a window, minimum spacing, forbidden transitions, and the first trial.

Two things the specification got wrong, found by the implementation.
First, "swap the offending trial with a random later one" traps itself at
the end of the schedule and failed about 15 percent of easy designs
(three rows, ten repetitions, no immediate repeat); the shipped repair
draws a random start and tries up to 64 slots, wrapping, taking the first
swap that leaves both positions legal, which passes every property check
in a fraction of the time. Second, the claim that interleaved track trials
and re-queues "can only widen a gap or break a run" was false: a
re-queued trial is a trial the observer sees, and a schedule made of
identical catch trials (the second USAGE example) cannot be ordered to
satisfy any spacing rule at all. So constraints are also enforced while
the session runs: before handing out a scheduled trial, `next` checks it
against the trials already run; if it would break a rule, a track trial
runs instead while any track is live, else the first later slot that fits
is pulled forward, and if nothing fits the trial runs and its history
entry carries a violation flag. With tracks, a failed open-time repair is
therefore not an error; without tracks it still is.

### `track_rate`, not a merged schedule

Tracks end when their own stop rule fires, which the sequencer cannot
predict, so a merged schedule with fixed positions for track trials would
run out of track before or after the conditions. A rate keeps the mix
right on average and degrades gracefully: when the tracks finish, the
schedule runs alone; when the schedule finishes, the tracks run alone.
The default is 1 with no conditions and 0 with no tracks, and required
otherwise, so a mixed design states its intention.

### One generator, consumed in a fixed order

Every random choice (the shuffle, the repair, practice draws, track picks,
re-queue positions) draws from the caller's generator in a fixed order.
That is what makes `psytr_restore` work: a fresh open with the same seed
rebuilds the same schedule, and replaying the outcomes makes the same
run-time draws in the same order. The header owns no generator, as the
rest of the collection does not; `psytr_splitmix` is a step function on
state the caller owns.

### Breaks are the caller's, their trace is the header's

The header has no clock, so a break by elapsed time is the caller's check
between trials. What the header owns is the trace: `block_size` gives
scheduled boundaries and `psytr_mark_break` records an unscheduled one,
both flagged in the history, and both end a run for the constraints,
because a run of three orientations before a rest and three after is not
a run anyone perceives. `constraints_span_blocks` turns that off for a
design that wants the stricter reading.

### Warmup is a condition trial, never a track trial

`n_warmup` trials at the start of every later block, drawn from a
caller-named list of easy conditions, flagged and excluded from tallies
and constraints, are a reintroduction after a rest. They are never drawn
from a track: the header does not know what an easy level is. A caller
who wants a staircase warmed up sees the flag on a condition trial, shows
what it likes, and chooses whether the track hears about it.

### The header saves its state, not the experiment's data

The sequencer's state is small and scalar, so it saves three ways: CSV
rows for analysis, a key=value metadata line to head a data file, and a
versioned byte snapshot (`psytr_save`, `psytr_load`) that resumes a
crashed session without replaying the seed. No JSON parser: a header that
parses text is the wrong header. The caller's per-trial data is
deliberately bounded to `record_size` bytes. Anything large or variable
(an eye trace, an EEG epoch, audio) belongs in its own container keyed by
the trial index, with a reference in the fixed record if one is needed.
The sequencer's table stays narrow and joins on trial index, which is
how every analysis pipeline already works.

### Fixed capacity, inline

`PSYTR_MAX_TRIALS` (4096) and `PSYTR_MAX_CONDITIONS` (1024) size the
handle at compile time: 19 bytes per trial, 91480 bytes (89 KB) at the
defaults on x86-64 in v0.1.1, 110528 bytes (108 KB) in v0.2. A session of more than 4096 trials is two handles.
The caller's per-trial record is the one variable-size
thing and lives in a buffer the caller provides, sized by
`record_size x PSYTR_MAX_TRIALS`, so nothing allocates.

### What PsychoPy replay can and cannot check

PsychoPy shuffles with NumPy's generator. The orders cannot match trial
for trial unless this header reproduces NumPy's Mersenne Twister and its
shuffle, which it will not. The comparison therefore checks properties
against PsychoPy: under `random`, every condition once per repetition
block and the blocks in order; under `fullRandom`, every condition exactly
`nReps` times; under `sequential`, the identical order. The constraint
rules are checked directly on generated orders, and the failure path is
checked with a design known to be impossible.

### v0.2: tables are a separate header

The conditions file, the trial list in a pack and the table a script
makes are one thing, so they have one form: the PSTB block of
psy_table.h. It is position independent, so a pack can map it and a CSV
parse can build it in an arena; both give the same bytes and the same
hash. psy_trials.h requires psy_table.h, as psy_gfx.h requires
psy_color.h, and compiles its implementation with its own. The split
keeps a CSV parser out of the trial sequencer for a caller who only views
packed tables, and gives the parser its own test, fuzz target and
mutation list. psy_table.md has the parser's decisions: the RFC 4180
dialect, the bounds (32767 rows, 64 columns, 4096 bytes per field), the
correctly rounded number syntax with no locale, int32 integer columns,
and errors that name the line, the row and the column.

A table's rows are the conditions and its columns the factors, a factor's
levels the column's distinct values in order of first appearance. A rule
names a level by number in C and by its text in the rules text; a numeric
column compares by value, so `0.50` finds `0.5`. A fixed trial list
played in file order is a table with SEQUENTIAL order and 1 repetition;
nothing more is needed.

### v0.2: sampling: jsPsych's types, mapped

| jsPsych `sample.type` | Here |
|---|---|
| `fixed-repetitions` | `reps` (or `cond_reps`) with FULL_RANDOM, the v0.1 order |
| `with-replacement` (size, weights) | `PSYTR_ORDER_WITH_REPLACEMENT`, `draws`, `weights` |
| `without-replacement` (size) | `subset` k with FULL_RANDOM and 1 repetition |
| `alternate-groups` (groups, randomize_group_order) | `groups` ALTERNATE, group order RANDOM or any other |
| `custom` (a function) | `PSYTR_ORDER_LIST`; the caller's function writes the list |

Two differences are deliberate. jsPsych cuts alternating groups of
unequal size to the smallest; this header refuses them and names the
sizes, because a silent cut changes the design. A subset is chosen once
at open and not again per repetition; a design that wants a new subset
per block is one handle per block.

Draws with replacement use cumulative weights and bisection. A linear
scan measured 39 ms for 10000 draws over 10000 rows; bisection measured
1 to 2 ms (indicative, not under the lock; the Cost table has the locked
numbers). The cumulative sums use the tally arrays as scratch, so the
handle did not grow for them.

### v0.2: nesting is one level

Groups are the one level of nesting. The schedule is a flat array fixed
at open, which preloading (`psytr_condition_at`) and replay need. Deeper
trees, parameters inherited down a tree, and nodes decided at run time
(jsPsych's loop and conditional functions) belong to an experiment
definition above this header. A blocked group is a block for every v0.1
purpose (first_in_block, warmups, constraint segments), so groups reuse
the block machinery and need no new run-time state.

### v0.2: units, not a repair rule

The first design treated "b always follows a" as one more rule for the
swap repair. A Python prototype of both the rule and the alternative,
units shuffled as wholes, measured this (200 or 50 seeds per design;
success count, median repair steps, maximum in brackets):

| Design | As a repaired rule | As units |
|---|---|---|
| 10a 10b 20c, a->b | 200/200, 10 (20) | 200/200, 0 |
| 40a 40b 80c, a->b | 200/200, 43 (75) | 200/200, 0 |
| 100a 100b + 4 x 50 fillers, a->b | 200/200, 123 (214) | 200/200, 0 |
| 40a 40b 80c, a->b, max run 2 | 50/50, 5984 (62656) | 50/50, 172 (298) |
| 100a 100b + 4 x 50, a->b, max run 2 | 50/50, 139 (194) | 50/50, 5 (10) |
| 40a 40b 40c 40d, a->b, max run 1 | 50/50, 176 (592) | 50/50, 26 (44) |
| 20a 30b 50c (spare b), max run of c 2 | 50/50, 43 (83) | 50/50, 46 (72) |

The repair also biases the order. Over every valid order of a small
design, the chi-square of the observed against a uniform distribution
(99.9 % critical value in brackets):

| Design | Valid orders | As a repaired rule | As units |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2a 2b 2c, a->b | 6 | 730.6 (15) | 2.7 |
| 2a 2b 3c, a->b, max run of c 2 | 7 | 1743.5 (17) | 1223.1 |
| 2a 2b 2c 2d, a->b, max run 1 | 42 | 2689.7 (69) | 270.6 |

With no other rule, units give a uniform order at no repair cost. With
other rules, the repair moves whole units and is still biased, much less
than the rule-based repair. The first unit repair swapped units of equal
length and failed 0/50 on the tight design (40a 40b 80c, max run 2): when
every one-trial unit is a c, a swap of two of them changes nothing. The
shipped repair moves a unit to another boundary and closes the gap, which
passes 50/50.

followed_by and preceded_by pair the trials by a shuffle, so spare
b-trials are free trials and fewer b- than a-trials is an error at open.
A chunk column makes longer units (a cue, a target and a probe that run
together). Two structural rules may not touch the same rows: a longer
unit is a chunk column, and overlapping pairs have no clear meaning.

At run time a unit runs back to back: no track trial, no draw, no
forward move and no block start inside it. A block_size boundary waits
for the unit's end, and the later blocks keep the block_size grid, so a
unit costs one block a few trials and does not shift the rest. A re-queue
of any trial in a unit re-queues the whole unit, because a b without its
a is not the trial the design asked for.

### v0.2: balance by Euler circuit

Transition balance (every ordered pair of levels adjacent equally often)
is exact, not scored. A balanced order is an Euler circuit of the
complete directed graph on the levels, each arc lambda times. Kandel,
Matias, Unger and Winkler (1996) draw such a circuit uniformly; Brooks
(2012) recommends it for exactly this use. The prototype checked
uniformity over every balanced order of small designs:

| Levels | lambda | Self pairs | Orders | Draws | chi-square / df |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 1 | yes | 4 | 40000 | 1.8 / 3 |
| 3 | 1 | yes | 216 | 43200 | 215.3 / 215 |
| 2 | 2 | yes | 36 | 40000 | 21.2 / 35 |
| 3 | 1 | no | 18 | 40000 | 16.0 / 17 |
| 4 | 1 | no | 3072 | 614400 | 3026.3 / 3071 |

The C test repeats the 3-level cases on the header (chi-square 183.0 on
215 df with self pairs, 19.7 on 17 without).

A circuit of n^2 lambda arcs visits n^2 lambda + 1 positions, so one
level occurs once more than the others. The header puts that trial
first, as a LEAD-IN, so all transitions occur and the other trials keep
equal counts (Brooks: "each sequence contains an extra trial of one
condition"). The lead-in is on by default because a missing transition
is a silent loss and an extra trial is visible. It is a main trial (the
observer sees it and the rules count it), flagged PSYTR_FLAG_LEADIN, with
rep -1 and no tally, and it cannot be re-queued.
`PSYTR_BALANCE_NO_LEADIN` leaves it out for a short sequence that cannot
afford the trial; one transition, last to first, is then missing, and
the manual says so. The test runs both.

No field was added to `psytr_trial_info` for the lead-in. A positional
initializer of the struct in the examples broke under
`-Wmissing-field-initializers` when one was, and callers have the same
initializers; the history flag and rep -1 tell the lead-in.

A rule on the balanced factor itself is refused. Rejection of balanced
orders with a run limit fails as sessions grow. The prototype measured
the chance that a uniform balanced order (with self pairs) meets a run
limit:

| Levels | lambda | Trials | P(run <= 2) | P(run <= 3) | P(run <= 4) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 4 | 17 | 0.003 | 0.360 | 0.811 |
| 2 | 16 | 65 | 0.000 | 0.002 | 0.070 |
| 4 | 4 | 65 | 0.014 | 0.657 | 0.961 |
| 4 | 16 | 257 | 0.000 | 0.042 | 0.552 |
| 8 | 4 | 257 | 0.035 | 0.826 | 0.992 |
| 8 | 16 | 1025 | 0.000 | 0.211 | 0.856 |

A repair would break the balance, and no exact sampler gives both
properties. `psytr_balance_no_repeat` covers the common case (no level
twice in a row) exactly. Rules on other factors are repaired by swaps
between trials of the same balanced level, which keep every transition.

### v0.2: latin squares by participant

`psytr_latin(n, row, balanced, out)` gives one row of a cyclic or a
Williams (1949) square, with the row taken modulo the design's rows, so a
participant number goes in directly. It is one function, not a design
object: a row is an order list, a group order (LATIN, BALANCED_LATIN) or
a session plan, and the caller stores nothing. For odd n the Williams
design needs 2n rows (each row and its reverse); the function returns the
row count so the caller can plan recruitment.

### v0.2: the rules text

The rules text maps 1:1 onto the C calls: the verbs are the C helper
names (`max_run target 3` is `psytr_max_run`). `psytr_format_rules`
writes a session's settings in the same text, so a logged session pastes
back in, and the bindings take the same text. Columns and levels go by
name, which the C API cannot do without the table.

| Source | Form | What was taken |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSesame loop operations | `constrain col maxrep=N mindist=D`, `weight col`, `shuffle` | the three lines, with OpenSesame's meaning (mindist counts rows, so `mindist=2` is `min_gap 1`) |
| OpenSesame | `slice`, `sort`, `sortby`, `reverse`, `roll`, `shuffle_horiz`, `fullfactorial`, `setcycle` | refused by name with a reason; they edit the table, which the caller does before open |
| jsPsych `sample` | an object per timeline | the sample types, as statements (`draws`, `subset`, `groups`) |
| PsychoPy loop | `Selected rows` | `where COLUMN=VALUE`, with `@participant` for one list per participant |
| Mix (van Casteren and Davis 2006) | max repetition, min distance | already in v0.1 as max_run and min_gap |

An unknown verb that is close to a known one gets "did you mean"; a word
from another tool (maxrep, mindist) gets the statement here. The
participant number is session data, so it comes from the call, never
from the text: one rules file serves every participant.

### v0.2: snapshots: format 1 stays

A desc with no v0.2 field saves format 1, the v0.1.1 bytes, so a v0.1
snapshot loads in v0.2 and a v0.1 session saves bytes v0.1.1 can load.
A desc with any v0.2 field saves format 2, which adds the table's hash,
the v0.2 desc fields, a hash of the order list, weights and group list
(arrays the handle does not keep), and the unit and lead-in state. load()
takes the format the desc implies and names the first desc field that
differs, so a snapshot cannot resume under a changed table or list.

### v0.2: not done

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Second-order or higher transition balance | no exact sampler is known to be practical; first order covers the designs in the rig plan |
| Balance with tracks, groups or units | track trials and unit boundaries cut transitions |
| A rule on the balanced factor | measured above: rejection fails as sessions grow |
| A new subset per repetition | one handle per block does it |
| Trees deeper than one group level, run-time nodes | experiment definition, above this header |
| OpenSesame's table edits (slice, sort, roll) | the caller edits the table before open |
| More than 32767 rows or 64 columns | psy_table.h bounds; refused by name |

### v0.2: bindings

The Python binding (`psy.trials`, version 0.2.0) takes a `Table` from
CSV text or a file, every v0.2 desc field as a keyword, the rules text,
and the helpers `followed_by`, `preceded_by`, `chunk`, `balance`,
`groups`, `latin` and `latin_rows`. The MEX function takes `desc.table`
(CSV text, or a struct with the CSV and its options), the same desc
fields and the rules text, and adds the commands `table`, `latin`,
`balance`, `chunk`, `followed_by`, `preceded_by`, `values`, `table_info`
and `format_rules`. Both builds stage psy_table.h beside psy_trials.h.

### v0.2.1: jitter in the trial handler

A foreperiod, an inter-trial interval or an SOA that varies from trial
to trial is a random draw like the order, so it belongs to the same
generator and the same contract (rig_spec 14.7 rank 9). In the session
it gets three things a caller's own draw does not: `psytr_restore()` and
`psytr_load()` reproduce it, the data line logs it, and a table column
can set its interval per condition. The header draws and logs; the
caller waits.

Decisions, each with its reason:

- Seconds, the user's unit for definitions and data (decided
  2026-10-07), with `ns` as int64 for a clock and `frames` for a snapped
  draw. A draw is a whole number of nanoseconds; `s` is that number
  over 1e9, correctly rounded. The data line prints the seconds as the
  exact decimal of `ns` (`1.184516667`), so the logged value is the value
  waited.
- One variate per jitter per trial. No rejection loop, so the generator's
  position after a trial does not depend on the values drawn, and a
  mutant or a bug that changes a value cannot shift the later draws.
- Integer arithmetic only, from the variate's 53 bits. The first version
  mapped the exponential through the C library's `log1p` and `expm1`, and
  the libraries round those differently: over 1,000,000 draws the
  doubles' bits differed between glibc 2.35, mingw-w64 and the UCRT,
  though the nanoseconds agreed. Agreement on a sample is not a
  guarantee (a last-bit difference can flip a rounding on some draw),
  and the Python binding must regenerate a Windows session exactly, so
  the coordinator asked for psy_rdk.h's standard: the same bits on every C
  library, compiler and flag set. Every draw is now integer arithmetic,
  with no libm call and no floating-point operation that -Ofast,
  /fp:fast or FMA contraction could change; the seconds-to-nanoseconds
  conversion reads the double's bits. Golden digests of 200,000 draws of
  each kind are checked by the test on every CI platform and by
  `tests/adapt/psy_trials_jitter_repro.c` under -O3 -march=native and
  -Ofast.
- The exponential is the untruncated inverse CDF, E = s (-ln(1 - u)),
  folded into the interval: lo + (E mod (hi - lo)). The exponential is
  memoryless, so the folded value is exactly the truncated exponential,
  and no exp() is needed, only one logarithm. The cost is that the map is
  no longer monotone in u; nothing in the header needs it to be.
- -ln(1 - u) is a Q58 fixed-point logarithm: y = 1 - u as m 2^e, m
  times a table reciprocal of 1 + i/128 (i its next 7 bits, rounded up
  so 0 <= t < 2^-7), and ln(1 + t) by an integer Horner series of degree
  8. The 128 reciprocals and their logarithms come from mpmath at 300
  bits (`tests/compare/trials_jitter_ref.py tables`). Error by analysis
  under 2^-57; measured 0.71 x 2^-58 at worst over 1,000,000 values
  against mpmath (`trials_jitter_ref.py check` on the output of
  `tests/compare/trials_jitter_dump.c`), and the test checks 123 points
  within 1 unit of the rounded reference. The duration is then within
  0.5 ns + s x 7e-18 of s (-ln(1 - u)) for the variate's 53 bits.
- 128-bit products and quotients use the compiler's `unsigned __int128`,
  or MSVC's `_umul128` and `_udiv128`, where they exist, and 32-bit
  pieces elsewhere. Both give the same exact integers; the test and the
  digests also run with the pieces forced (`-DPSYTR__NO_U128`).
- The jitter draws come after all of next()'s own draws for the trial,
  and open() draws none. A desc without jitters therefore draws exactly
  as v0.2.0 did (the v0.2.0 pins below), and a desc with jitters has the
  schedule it would have without them; the test checks both by logging
  the generator.
- Three distributions. UNIFORM is the common case. CHOICE covers a list
  of SOAs or a hand-made distribution (repeat a value to weight it).
  EXPONENTIAL truncated to [lo, hi] is the non-aging foreperiod: its
  constant hazard keeps the observer's expectancy flat. Normal, log-normal
  and gamma foreperiods were left out: their hazards rise, which is the
  aging the exponential exists to avoid, and CHOICE can approximate any of
  them.
- Snapping draws the frame, not a continuous value then rounded.
  Rounding a uniform draw gives the two end frames half the weight of the
  others; drawing the frame index makes every whole frame in [lo, hi]
  equally likely. The snapped exponential is a geometric over the frames,
  exactly memoryless on the frame grid.
- A frame is inside [lo, hi] when its time rounded to the nanosecond
  is, computed in integers. In binary 0.07 x 100 is 7.000000000000001 and
  0.29 x 100 is 28.999999999999996, so a floating-point test would drop
  the frames at 0.07 s and 0.29 s; the first version needed a tolerance
  of 1e-9 frames for that, which integer arithmetic made unnecessary.
  Mutants j-01 and j-02 check both ends. No frame inside is an error at
  open that names the rate and the interval.
- Storage: 8 bytes per trial per jitter, PSYTR_MAX_JITTERS (4) of them,
  so the handle grew from 110528 to 243344 bytes; `-DPSYTR_MAX_JITTERS=1`
  makes it 143744. Storing the variate instead costs the same, and
  recomputing the value on access would run the inverse CDF on every
  read.
- The call level (`psytr_jitter_draw`, `psytr_jitter_map`) touches no
  session. A draw from the session's generator between next() and
  update() would move every later draw and `psytr_restore()` would not
  repeat it, so the manual sends replayable designs to `desc.jitters`.

The hazard of the snapped exponential, 0.5 to 2.0 s, scale 0.4 s, at 60
Hz, measured by the test on 1,000,000 draws as count(k) / count(>= k):

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Flat per-frame hazard, 1 - e^-(T/s) | 0.04081 (2.4486 /s against 1/s = 2.5 /s; 2.1 % low) |
| Truncation factor 3 s before hi, 1 / (1 - e^-3) (theory) | 1.052 |
| Measured per-frame hazard against flat, up to 0.8 s (hi - 3 s) | within 6.2 % |
| Measured against the truncated geometric's exact hazard, while at least 20,000 draws survive (to 1.75 s) | within 4.4 % (sampling noise) |
| Mass the truncation moves from beyond hi into [lo, hi], e^-(hi-lo)/s | 2.4 % |

Snapping itself adds no deviation from a flat per-frame hazard; the
deviation is the truncation's, as for the continuous distribution, and
it is under 6 % until 3 scales before hi.


## Verification (v0.2)

All on Windows 11 with MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 (C11, C99, C++17, warnings as
errors) and MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX, C and C++17), and on Linux (WSL2) with
gcc 11.4 as C11 and C++17 under AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, with no report. The header's STATUS block
lists every check; in summary:

- v0.1 behavior: the hashes of 600 v0.1.1 sessions (30 designs x 20
  seeds; schedule, history, tallies, records, format lines and snapshot
  bytes) match on gcc, MSVC and Linux gcc. Both v0.1 examples print what
  v0.1.1 printed but the version token.
- `tests/adapt/psy_trials_test_v02.h`, at `PSYTR_MAX_TRIALS` 4096 and 256:
  each v0.2 order's properties by chi-square against its stated
  distribution (draws against weights, pairs of draws, subsets, group
  orders, unit orders, the slot of a free trial, balanced orders over all
  216 and all 18 of two small designs); exact counts where the design
  promises them (Latin and Williams squares for n = 1 to 64, the pair
  counts of 1600 balanced orders, 0 broken pairs in 200 unit sessions with
  re-queues and blocks); the rules text against the C calls; snapshot
  format 2 loaded at every third cut; and a digest of v0.2 sessions,
  `c9b59a3bb40a8f68` on every compiler and on Linux.

| Statistic | Value | df |
|---|---|---|
| Draws against weights, worst of three weight sets | 0.20 of the 99.9 % bound | 1 to 3 |
| Pairs of successive draws | 1.3 | 8 |
| 2-subsets of 5 | 13.8 | 9 |
| RANDOM group order | 3.1 | 5 |
| Units, the 6 valid orders | 7.4 | 5 |
| Balance, 3 levels with self pairs, 216 orders | 183.0 | 215 |
| Balance, 3 levels without self pairs, 18 orders | 19.7 | 17 |

- `tests/adapt/psy_table_test.c` for the parser; docs/psy_table.md has
  its results (10,000,084 numbers against strtod on each Windows
  compiler, 0 disagreements).
- Fuzzing, MSVC 19.44 libFuzzer with AddressSanitizer, from the seeds the
  targets write, then the corpus replayed on Linux gcc 11.4 under ASan
  and UBSan as C11 and C++17:

| Target | Time | Inputs | Coverage features | Corpus | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/fuzz/psy_table_fuzz.c` | 1351 s | 5,906,077 | 3208 | 958 | no crash, no timeout; replay clean |
| `tests/fuzz/psy_trials_fuzz.c` | 1351 s | 9,734,743 | 7493 | 1383 | no crash, no timeout; replay clean |

  The trials target reads rules text against a fixed table, opens with
  a repair budget of 2000 swaps, and runs up to 300 trials with
  re-queues, breaks, the format functions and a save and load.
- Mutations (`tests/mutate/trials.toml`: 6 in the v0.1 core, which the
  pins must catch, and 23 in the v0.2 code): 29 killed. Three needed new
  checks before they were: u-01 (the unit move does not check the slot
  that closes the gap) is caught by the digest; u-05 (a chunk that joins
  rows that are not next to each other) needed the chi-square of a free
  trial's slot; and s-01 (`>=` in the draw bisection) needed draws
  with the variate fixed at 0 and 0.5, because only a variate exactly on a
  running sum tells the two apart and then picks a zero-weight row.
  `tests/mutate/table.toml`: 24 of 25 killed, the survivor equivalent
  (docs/psy_table.md).
- Python binding: 152 tests, among them the parser against Python's `csv`
  module (40 random files) and `float()` (5000 values). MEX: the v0.2
  part of `test_mex.m` passes in MATLAB R2023a and Octave 10.1.

Not done: a run on macOS or big-endian hardware; the extra gcc 11.4
warnings and the clang 11.1 builds that v0.1.1 ran.

## Cost (v0.2)

All on the Iris Xe laptop, AC, the measurement lock held (`guard.sh time
trials`), 2026-10-07, `examples/trials_bench.c`, 21 rounds, MinGW gcc 16.1
-O2 and MSVC 19.44 /O2, built with `PSYTR_MAX_TRIALS` and
`PSYTR_MAX_CONDITIONS` at 16384 so one handle holds 10,000 trials (the
handle is then 608192 bytes). The table has 10,000 rows; open() builds
the whole schedule.

| Design | Trials | gcc median ms (min to max) | MSVC median ms (min to max) | Repair steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| List in file order (SEQUENTIAL) | 10000 | 0.02 (0.02 to 0.26) | 0.02 (0.02 to 0.22) | 0 |
| FULL_RANDOM | 10000 | 0.04 (0.04 to 0.04) | 0.04 (0.04 to 0.05) | 0 |
| CONSTRAINED, max_run 3 on 4 levels | 10000 | 1.82 (1.25 to 2.36) | 1.54 (1.08 to 1.90) | 159 |
| Units (followed_by) + max_run 3 | 10000 | 5.02 (4.20 to 6.19) | 7.03 (5.31 to 9.78) | 168 |
| WITH_REPLACEMENT, 10,000 draws of 10,000 rows | 10000 | 0.73 (0.73 to 0.75) | 1.33 (1.30 to 1.36) | 0 |
| Subset 5,000 of 10,000, FULL_RANDOM | 5000 | 0.14 (0.13 to 0.14) | 0.14 (0.14 to 0.15) | 0 |
| Balance, 8 levels | 9985 | 0.26 (0.26 to 0.27) | 0.30 (0.29 to 0.33) | 0 |
| BLOCKED groups (8, Williams) + max_run 3 | 10000 | 1.79 (1.61 to 2.00) | 1.73 (1.60 to 2.66) | 119 |

open() runs before the session, so these costs are outside any frame.
At run time, next() + update() over 5 runs of the units design with 5 %
re-queues (54,034 calls) took 0.04 us on average on both compilers; the
worst call was 19.0 us under gcc and 2.2 us under MSVC, the worst case a
forward move or a unit re-queue, far inside a 16 ms frame.

Two v0.2 paths changed because of indicative runs (not under the lock):
the subset's check of the remaining counts went from O(n k) to a
histogram (30 ms to 0.2 ms for 5,000 of 10,000), and draws with
replacement from a linear scan to bisection (39 ms to 1 to 2 ms).


## Verification and cost (v0.2.1)

All on Windows 11 with MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 (C11, C99, C++17, warnings as
errors) and MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX, C and C++17), on Linux (WSL2) with gcc
11.4 as C11 and C++17 under AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and at `PSYTR_MAX_TRIALS` 256 and
`PSYTR_MAX_JITTERS` 1.

- Bit identity of the jitter draws: `tests/adapt/psy_trials_jitter_golden.h`
  digests 200,000 draws of each of six kinds (uniform, choice and the
  truncated exponential, each continuous and snapped). The test checks
  them, so CI checks them on Linux (gcc, clang), macOS arm64, Windows MSVC
  and MinGW; CI also builds `tests/adapt/psy_trials_jitter_repro.c` with
  -O3 -march=native (-mcpu=native on macOS), -Ofast and -Ofast native.
  By hand: MinGW gcc 16.1 at -O0, -O2, -O3 -march=native, -Ofast, -Ofast
  -march=native -ffp-contract=fast; MSVC 19.44 at /Od, /O2, /O2 /fp:fast,
  /O2 /arch:AVX2 /fp:fast; WSL gcc 11.4 at -O2, -O3 -march=native,
  -Ofast, -Ofast -march=native, with ASan and UBSan, and as C++ at -Ofast;
  each with the 128-bit types and with `-DPSYTR__NO_U128`: every digest
  the same. The Python binding computes the same six digests from
  `pt.splitmix` and `pt.jitter_map` in its tests.
- The fixed-point logarithm against mpmath: 0.71 x 2^-58 at worst over
  1,000,000 values; 123 points checked by the test within 1 unit of the
  rounded reference; the conversions (seconds to nanoseconds from the
  double's bits, frames to nanoseconds, the frames inside an interval)
  against exact values, including a frame at 0.5 ns that rounds outside.
- Bit identity of v0.2.0: `tests/adapt/psy_trials_pins_v02.h` holds the
  hashes of 320 sessions (16 v0.2 designs x 20 seeds, through the v0.1 pin
  script: re-queues, marked breaks, records, a mid-session snapshot, the
  tallies and the format lines but the version token), generated by
  v0.2.0 (`psy_trials_pin_gen.c -DPIN_V02`). They and the 600 v0.1.1 pins
  match on every build above. The v0.2 digest now leaves out the rules
  text's version line, and v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 give the same value.
- `tests/adapt/psy_trials_test_jitter.h`: every refusal by name; values
  at fixed variates and frame ends (frames 7 and 29 for [0.07, 0.29] s at
  100 Hz); each distribution against its CDF on 200,000 draws (the
  snapped exponential on 1,000,000), worst chi-square at 0.80 of its
  99.9 % bound, and the truncated exponential's mean within 5 standard
  errors; 20,000 random intervals and rates whose snapped draws stay
  inside; `ns` against k x den x 1e9 / num in integer arithmetic; the draw
  order against a logged generator (open() draws none, each trial's own
  draws are those of the same session without jitters, then one per
  jitter; the pending trial draws none); `psytr_restore()` and
  save/load at cut points (format 3) reproduce every draw and data line;
  per-condition columns and their 9 refusals; the rules text round trip
  and 12 messages.
- Fuzzing: `tests/fuzz/psy_trials_fuzz.c` now reads every jitter's draw
  each trial and seeds three jitter rule texts. MSVC 19.44 libFuzzer with
  AddressSanitizer, 1201 s from its 18 seeds with the first (libm)
  version: 9,003,538 inputs; then 601 s more on that corpus with the
  integer version: 4,221,162 inputs, 9353 coverage features, 2495 corpus
  files. No crash and no timeout; the corpus replayed on Linux gcc 11.4
  under ASan and UBSan, C11 and C++17, with no report.
- Mutations: 18 jitter mutants in `tests/mutate/trials.toml`, all killed
  (47 in the file, all as expected), among them both frame ends, the
  fold into the interval, the log series' sign, the ln 2 count, the
  rounding of seconds and of frames to nanoseconds, and the seconds as a
  product with 1e-9 instead of a division. j-10 (the data line without
  zero padding) survived its first run; the test now checks a 2 s draw
  prints as `2.000000000`. A mutant that skipped normalizing the frame
  scale to 63 bits survived as equivalent, and the normalization was
  removed (62 bits are kept).
- Python binding: 156 tests pass (4 for jitter: the session and its
  replay, columns, rules and errors, `jitter_map` against the maps
  written from their definitions, and the six golden digests). MEX: `test_mex.m` passes in
  MATLAB R2023a and Octave 10.1, the jitter part included.

Cost, measured on the Iris Xe laptop, AC, the measurement lock held,
2026-10-07, `examples/trials_bench.c`, 21 rounds:

| Measure | gcc 16.1 -O2 | MSVC 19.44 /O2 |
|---|---|---|
| `psytr_jitter_draw`, uniform snapped to 60000/1001 Hz, median | 66.0 ns | 53.8 ns |
| exponential snapped, median | 81.6 ns | 108.6 ns |
| exponential, median | 32.4 ns | 62.1 ns |
| choice of 4, median | 12.4 ns | 15.5 ns |
| next() + update(), units design with 5 % re-queues, mean / worst | 0.05 / 4.3 us | 0.05 / 3.0 us |
| the same with 4 jitters, mean / worst | 0.16 / 5.2 us | 0.20 / 4.8 us |

The draws include a splitmix step and the desc check that
`psytr_jitter_draw` repeats on every call; a session's draws skip it.
The snapped kinds pay for 128-bit divisions (the frames inside the
interval, then the frame's nanoseconds). Measured on the way: with the
divisions as a bit-by-bit loop the snapped draws took 580 to 680 ns
(gcc), and with MSVC's 128-bit product from 32-bit pieces the
exponential took 88 ns, so the header uses the compilers' 128-bit types
and `_umul128` / `_udiv128` where they exist. The first, libm version
took 47 / 25 ns (uniform snapped), 149 / 50 ns (exponential snapped),
118 / 34 ns (exponential) and 26 / 18 ns (choice). The larger handle costs a design
without jitters nothing measurable: the v0.2.0 bench, built against the
v0.2.0 header and against v0.2.1 (4 slots and 1) and run interleaved
twice under the lock, gave open() medians within 0.01 ms for the cheap
designs and within 0.2 ms (3 %, inside the run-to-run spread) for the
units design.

## Verification (v0.1)

The header's STATUS block has the numbers. In summary:

- Compile checks as C99, C11 and C++17 with warnings as errors, and MSVC
  /W4 /WX in its default C dialect and as C++17.
- `tests/adapt/psy_trials_test.c`, at `PSYTR_MAX_TRIALS` 256 and at the
  default 4096: the factorial index round trip; each order's properties
  over 400 seeds; each constraint rule holding on every repaired order of
  eight designs x 200 seeds, by a checker written separately from the
  header's, and the repair's failure message on an impossible set; tracks
  interleaved with `track_rate` at 0 (rejected with conditions), 0.5 and
  1, checking the mix and that a finished track is never picked; practice
  and warmup flagged and untallied; re-queues with and without a gap, and
  760 random re-queues under a no-repeat rule with no unflagged violation;
  `psytr_mark_break` ending a run; tallies against a hand count;
  `psytr_restore` reproducing a run bit for bit, with and without tracks;
  `psytr_save` at 42 cut points then `psytr_load` into a garbage-filled
  handle, identical to the uninterrupted run, snapshot bytes included;
  every load refusal and every rejected desc; the format functions against
  fixed strings.
- `examples/trials_mocs.c` (constant stimuli with a constraint, printing
  the proportions and a CSV) and `examples/trials_interleave.c` (three
  psy_stair.h staircases and a catch condition, the second USAGE example
  run for real, printing which track each trial went to). Both exit 0
  with no hardware, and print the same bytes under gcc and MSVC.
- `tests/compare/compare_trials_psychopy.py` runs `psy.trials` beside
  `psychopy.data.TrialHandler` and `TrialHandlerExt` on the same condition
  lists over 100 seeds: SEQUENTIAL is identical to PsychoPy's order, RANDOM
  holds each condition once per repetition block on both sides, and
  FULL_RANDOM, weighted or not, gives exact counts on both sides.

Not done: a run on macOS or on big-endian hardware, and a load of a
snapshot written by another compiler. The snapshot's portability is by
construction, not by test.
