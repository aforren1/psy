# ysp/box.h

Status: v0.2.0, 2026-10-08. The header's manual (its comment block) is the
reference for each frame, query and output. This page records why the
header has its form, what its bytes were checked against, and what is not
checked. The plan is `docs/devices_spec.md` (sections 4.3 and 10); this
header is part of its steps 2 and 3.

## Why a pure header

A decoder takes bytes and the time they were read, and gives events and
clock pairs. It does no I/O, starts no thread, reads no clock and
allocates nothing (devices_spec principle 3). So:

- a test feeds it generated or captured bytes, split anywhere;
- an analysis can decode a raw capture of a session with this header
  alone;
- `ysp/device.h` owns the threads, the transport and the clock.

## Families

| Family | Frames | Clock | Queries | Checked against |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `YBOX_XID` | `'k'`, info, uint32 LE ms (6 bytes); `"_e5"` + uint32 LE (7 bytes) | the box's ms timer | `"_e5"` (timer), `"_c1"` (identity) | pyxid2 (cedrus-opensource/pyxid at `d5b0a73`, 2025-01-14): `unpack('<cBI')` for key frames with port `& 0x0F`, key `(info & 0xE0) >> 5` (0 means 8), pressed `0x10`, frames with `info & 0x0C` refused; `unpack('<cccI')` for `"_e5"`; `"_c1"` answered `"_xid0"` in XID mode; `"_d2"`, `"_d3"`, `"_d4"` one byte each. Cedrus's XID command page agrees on the frame |
| `YBOX_LINE` | text lines (below) | the board's microsecond counter | `"q <seq>"`, `"i"` | this repository's own protocol and firmware |
| `YBOX_PHOTO` | `0xA5`, level, uint32 LE us; `0x5A`, 0, uint32 LE us | the board's microsecond counter | none | `tests/loopback/screen_loopback.c` |

XID also decodes the StimTracker 2 frame since v0.2.0: `'o'`, port, key
(0 means 8), `'1'` or `'0'`, uint32 LE ms, 0 (9 bytes; pyxid2
`unpack('<ccBcIB')`, Cedrus: "a terminating null byte").

## Outputs (v0.2.0)

`ybox_encode(family, op, code, arg, buf, cap)` gives the bytes; the
manual's OUTPUTS section has every byte. Each family's bytes are pinned to
a source:

| Family | Bytes | Who ends a pulse | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `YBOX_XID` | set `'m' 'h' lo hi`; width `'m' 'p'` + uint32 LE ms | the box, with the width of the last `mp`; `mp 0` makes `mh` hold | Cedrus [XID commands](https://www.cedrus.com/support/xid/commands.htm): "If the duration is 0 [default], then an mh command will set the output lines and hold them"; pyxid2 `d5b0a73`: `pack('<ccI', b'm', b'p', duration)`, `'mh'+chr(lines & 0xFF)+chr((lines >> 8) & 0xFF)` |
| `YBOX_LINE` | `o <code>\n`; `p <code> <us>\n` | the board | this repository (`firmware/ysp_line/`) |
| `YBOX_TRIGGERBOX` | one byte; `0xFF` before closing | the host | Brain Products, "TriggerBox Programming Examples" Rev03 ([PDF](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~tatiana/BrainVisionManuals/TriggerBox/TriggerBox_Programming_Examples_Rev03.pdf)): "Each byte written to the COM port is transmitted to the eight output lines (Bit 0 - Bit 7)"; "the output line should be reset to their default levels by writing a 0xFF"; port settings have no influence |
| `YBOX_BIOSEMI` | one byte | the interface, after 8 ms | BioSemi, [USB Trigger interface cable](https://www.biosemi.com/faq/USB%20Trigger%20interface%20cable.htm): 115200 baud, 8N1; "will hold this value for 8mS", then "all pins will be reset to zero". The USB-C model takes 1 to 99 ms by a command ([BioSemi](https://biosemi.com/faq/USB_Trigger_interface_ProgramPulseLength.htm)), not encoded |
| `YBOX_MMBTS` | one byte at 9600 baud | the box after 8 ms (switch P, factory) or the host (switch S) | Not the vendor's manual: chrplr/goxpyriment `triggers/notes/mmbts.md` (written from the manual v2.3, 2024: 9600 baud fixed, P and S modes, 1200 baud resets the box) and ebadier/NeurospecTriggerBox-Unity `SerialPort_MMBTS.cs` (9600 baud, one byte per trigger) |
| `YBOX_LINES` | none: DTR (bit 0) and RTS (bit 1) | the host | `ysp/serial.h` |
| `YBOX_PARALLEL` | one byte, the data lines | the host | `ysp/parallel.h` |

Left out: XID 1 devices' `ah` command (pyxid2 sends the inverted lines,
one byte), the BioSemi USB-C pulse-length command, BBTK TTL modules (no
byte protocol found), and the TriggerBox's input byte (counted as garbage).

## XID input layout: checked again (v0.2.0)

The v0.1.0 layout was checked a second time on 2026-10-08 against
pyxid2 at `d5b0a73` (fetched with `gh`, identical to the copy used for
v0.1.0) and Cedrus's command page:

| Item | v0.1.0 | Sources | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Key frame | `'k'`, info, uint32 LE ms; 6 bytes | Cedrus "six bytes ... `<"k"><key info><RT>`"; pyxid2 `'<cBI'` | Same |
| Info byte | bits 0 to 3 port, bit 4 pressed, bits 5 to 7 key, key 0 means 8; port bits 2 and 3 set: broken | Cedrus; pyxid2 `INVALID_PORT_BITS = 0x0C`, `KEY_RELEASE_BITMASK = 0x10` | Same |
| Timer answer | `"_e5"` + uint32 LE; 7 bytes | Cedrus; pyxid2 `'<cccI'` | Same |
| StimTracker 2 | not decoded | pyxid2 `'<ccBcIB'`, 9 bytes, for firmware 2 and product `S` | Missing: added in v0.2.0 |
| A broken frame | drop one byte, find the next frame | pyxid2 empties its buffer and flushes the port | Different on purpose: a resync keeps the frames after the noise |
| Baud | 115200 | pyxid2 tries 115200, 19200, 9600, 57600 and 38400 (a box's switches set it) | Different: `desc.baud` must be set for a box not at 115200 |
| Gaps between bytes | 1 ms per byte, every command | pyxid2: 1 ms; Cedrus: "XID 2 devices ... eliminates the need for an inter-byte delay" | Kept for queries; outputs go whole (docs/device.md) |
## The ysp line protocol

The plan's first draft had comma-separated lines (`t,<us>,<button>,<0|1>`).
The protocol as built has one letter per line type and spaces:

```
S <t>                  sync, every 100 ms
E <t> <ch> <0|1>       edge
A <t> <ch> <value>     sample
Q <seq> <t>            answer to "q <seq>"
I <text>               answer to "i"
O <t> <code>           the outputs changed (v0.2.0)
# <text>               comment
```

Host to board: `q <seq>`, `i`, and since v0.2.0 `o <code>` (hold) and
`p <code> <us>` (a pulse the board times). A board stamps `O` after its
pin writes, so the host has the board's own time of each output change.
Firmware without outputs ignores `o` and `p`.

Why:

- A letter per type lets one parser take syncs, edges, samples, answers
  and identity, and refuse the rest by name.
- Spaces are what `Serial.print` writes between numbers without format
  strings, so the firmware stays small and board-neutral.
- The sync gives the host pairs and a heartbeat when no edge comes; the
  query gives a bracketed pair (its width is the round trip), which a
  sparse device needs (docs/rt.md: sparse presses behind a 16 ms latency
  timer gave millisecond errors for minutes).
- A 64-bit decimal time is allowed, so a board with a 64-bit counter
  (the RP2040's `time_us_64()`) can send it; the reference firmware sends
  `micros()`, 32 bits, which the host unwraps.

## Decisions

| Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Output | The caller's arrays of events and pairs; the decoder stops when one is full, and after one LINE `O` report, and returns the bytes it used | No allocation, and a bounded output per call. A byte finishes at most one frame (a broken frame shows by its ninth byte at the latest, and the eight bytes fed again hold at most one frame of 6 bytes or more), so arrays of one entry suffice; mutant `box-11` writes one past them and the test catches it |
| A broken frame | Drop its first byte and feed the rest again | A frame that starts inside a broken one is still found. XID frames with port bits 2 or 3 set are broken, as pyxid2 says |
| Garbage | Counted per call and in total, never an event | A misaligned stream must not give a press. The device layer logs the total at most once a second |
| Event time | The read time given; `ticks` the device time with `YIN_DEVTICKS` | The decoder reads no clock; the device layer maps `ticks` through the fit |
| XID writes | `ybox_slow_write()`: one byte at a time, 1 ms apart | pyxid2 writes every command this way. Its reason is not stated; it is kept until a box shows it is not needed |
| A text line | At most 94 characters; printable ASCII only; an overlong line or a control byte drops the whole line | The rest of an overlong line must not read as a line of its own |
| Encoders | One function, `ybox_encode()`, with an op; capabilities in `ybox_caps()` | The device layer asks what a family can do (who ends a pulse, lines or bytes) instead of naming families |
| Output-only families | `ybox_init()` takes them; every byte is garbage | One decoder path for every instance; a TriggerBox that reports its inputs cannot be mistaken for frames |

## Verification

On 2026-10-08, MSVC 19.44 (`/W4 /WX`, C11, C++17), MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 and
gcc 11.4 on WSL2 (C99, C11, C++17, `-Werror`), ASan and UBSan on WSL2:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `tests/adapt/box_test.c`, v0.2.0 | 234 checks pass: the v0.1.0 checks, StimTracker 2 frames in every generated XID stream (whole, byte by byte, in chunks, with garbage), a broken StimTracker 2 frame with a key frame inside, `O` reports in every generated line stream and one per call, the bytes of every encoder and op, and 200,000 random bytes for each of the eight families (output-only families: every byte garbage) |
| `tests/adapt/box_test.c`, v0.1.0 | 135 checks pass. Each family: 1000 generated frames decoded whole, byte by byte and in random chunks, with output arrays of 64 and of 1, every field compared; 3 garbage bytes before each frame counted exactly; broken frames with a real frame inside found again; the line rules (seq 0, channel 0 and 256, level 2, missing and extra fields, 64-bit overflow, signs and exponents in samples, identity, comments, overlong lines, control bytes); 200,000 random bytes per family |
| `tests/compile/box.c`, `.cpp` | Build and run on both compilers |
| Mutants (`tests/mutate/box.toml`), v0.2.0 | 24 of 24 caught, the 11 new ones (`box-14` to `box-24`: XID byte order, ms rounding, a 0 ms pulse, the TriggerBox close byte, StimTracker 2 checks, one O report per call, output-only decoding, the DTR code range, single-byte pulses, the O code range) on the first run |
| Mutants, v0.1.0 | 13 of 13 caught. The first run caught 11: `box-11` (the reserve of 2 entries) was equivalent, which showed the reserve's reason was wrong (now 1 entry, and the mutant writes past the array), and `box-13` (an overlong line's tail read as a line) needed a check |
| Firmware (`firmware/ysp_line/ysp_line.ino`) | Compiles with arduino-cli 1.5.1 for `teensy:avr:teensy41` and `teensy40` (core 1.62.0) and `rp2040:rp2040:rpipico` (core 6.3.0, earlephilhower), in digital and analog mode; v0.2.0's outputs (`o`, `p`, `O`) also with three output pins in analog mode. Installed as a user, in `C:\tmp\psy-work\devices\arduino\`, not in the repository |

Not checked:

- Any byte from or to a Cedrus device. The XID decoder and encoders follow
  pyxid2's struct formats and Cedrus's page; a capture from a real box pins
  them before a timing claim. Whether the StimTracker 2 port byte is a
  number or an ASCII digit: pyxid2 keeps the raw byte, and so does `code`.
- Any byte to a TriggerBox, BioSemi interface or MMBT-S. The MMBT-S bytes
  come from open-source drivers, not from Neurospec's manual.
- The firmware on a board: not flashed, not run.
- XID1 devices, which have no timer query and use `ah` for outputs.
