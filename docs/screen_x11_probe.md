# X11 display-timing probe, 2026-10-09

This note describes a probe that measures display timing on a Linux X11
rig. Its results decide how the GLX backend of `ysp/screen.h`
(`YSCR_BACKEND_GLX_OML`, a stub today) is built. The plan that asks for
the backend is [rig_spec.md](rig_spec.md) section 4.2 ("Linux X11: GLX
sync control", separate X screens) and section 8 (timing model, tiers).
The Windows measurements that the probe mirrors are in
[screen.md](screen.md): depth, holding a frame, the onset as an
observation, path reports, slack.

The probe has not run on the rig yet. The results section at the end is
an empty template. Fill it from the archive that `run.sh` makes.

Code: `tests/probe/screen_x11/`

- `screen_x11_probe.c`: the probe, one C file, about 3000 lines.
- `build.sh`: builds it with `cc` (or `CC=clang`).
- `run.sh`: one command that builds, records the system, runs the probe
  twice and packs the result.

CMake does not build the probe. It is Linux only.

## 1. Run it

### 1.1 Install the packages

Debian or Ubuntu (names checked on Ubuntu 22.04):

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libx11-dev libxcb1-dev \
    libxcb-present-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libgl-dev libvulkan-dev \
    mesa-utils x11-utils x11-xserver-utils vulkan-tools pciutils
# optional: clang; libsdl3-0 where the release packages it (Ubuntu 22.04 does not)
```

Fedora (names checked on packages.fedoraproject.org):

```sh
sudo dnf install gcc pkgconf-pkg-config libX11-devel libxcb-devel \
    libglvnd-devel mesa-libGL-devel vulkan-headers vulkan-loader \
    glx-utils xdpyinfo xrandr xset vulkan-tools SDL3
# optional: clang
```

Arch (names checked on archlinux.org):

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel libx11 libxcb libglvnd mesa \
    vulkan-headers vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-radeon mesa-utils \
    xorg-xrandr xorg-xdpyinfo xorg-xset vulkan-tools sdl3
# optional: clang
```

Only libX11, libxcb (with its present and randr parts) and libGL are
linked. EGL, Vulkan, SDL3 and ANGLE are loaded at run time. When one is
missing, its section prints a message and the rest runs. The Vulkan
section also needs the Vulkan headers at build time.

### 1.2 Run

From the repository root, in a terminal on the X session:

```sh
sh tests/probe/screen_x11/run.sh
```

The script writes everything into `ysp_x11_probe_<date>_<time>/` in the
current folder and packs it into `ysp_x11_probe_<date>_<time>.tar.gz`.
Send that file back.

Before you start:

- Close programs that use the GPU. Keep the machine on AC power.
- Do not touch the mouse or keyboard during the run. The terminal keeps
  the keyboard focus, so Ctrl+C stops the probe early. The script then
  still makes the archive.
- The probe resets the X screen saver timer before each run. A DPMS
  setting can still blank a screen; `xset s off -dpms` turns both off
  until the next login.

What you see: each X screen goes dark gray. A 64 x 64 square at the top
left changes between black and white on every frame, for a photodiode.
There is no full-screen flicker.

How long: pass 1 (idle) is about 6 minutes with two X screens and about
3 minutes with one. Pass 2 (CPU and GPU load, fewer runs) is about 3
minutes. ANGLE adds about 2 minutes per screen.

### 1.3 Options

`run.sh` passes `PROBE_ARGS` to both passes. For example, with an ANGLE
build that has `libEGL.so` and `libGLESv2.so` in one folder:

```sh
PROBE_ARGS="--angle /path/to/angle/out" sh tests/probe/screen_x11/run.sh
```

To run the probe without the script, build it and call it:

```sh
sh tests/probe/screen_x11/build.sh              # makes tests/probe/screen_x11/build/screen_x11_probe
tests/probe/screen_x11/build/screen_x11_probe --help
```

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--out DIR` | Output folder (default `./ysp_x11_probe_<date>`) |
| `--frames N` | Swaps per run, default 600. Runs that hold 2 or 3 vblanks use N/2 and N/3, so each run takes about 10 s at 60 Hz |
| `--vblanks N` | Events in the vblank test, default 300 |
| `--screen N` | GLX and EGL tests on X screen N only, no two-screen phases |
| `--both` | Only the two-screen phases |
| `--no-both` | No two-screen phases |
| `--quick` | Fewer runs: `oml_k1`, `swap_wait`, `swap_pipe` |
| `--load N` | N busy threads for the whole run |
| `--gpu-heavy`, `--gpu-iters N` | A fragment shader with 400 (or N) dependent iterations per pixel every frame |
| `--late-every N` | Frame interval of the injected late frames, default 30 |
| `--wm` | Fullscreen through the window manager (`_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN`), not an override-redirect window |
| `--glx-compat` | A desktop GL context on GLX, not GL ES 3.0 |
| `--angle DIR` | Also run the EGL tests through ANGLE (Vulkan and GL back ends). `YSP_ANGLE_DIR` does the same |
| `--sleep-margin MS` | Time after the vblank at which a held frame's sleep ends, default 1.0 ms |
| `--no-rt` | Do not ask for `SCHED_FIFO` |
| `--skip-env`, `--skip-egl`, `--skip-sdl`, `--skip-vk` | Leave out a section |
| `--timeout S` | Stop after S seconds, default 1800 |

| Present mode | Counts of flip, copy, suboptimal copy, skip and no event |
| mode changes | How often the mode changed between frames |
| on target, late, early | Shown MSC against the target. "Late" also gives how many of the injected late frames were late |
| MSC step | The MSC difference between consecutive onsets: 0, 1, 2, 3 or more |
| swap call | Return minus call, microseconds |
| onset minus return | Latency from the swap call's return to the onset, milliseconds |
| known after onset | When the onset became known: `glXWaitForSbcOML` return, and Present event arrival, each minus the UST |
| grid residual | Distance of each onset from a straight-line fit of UST against MSC for that run |
| slack | The planned vblank's time minus the swap's return: the smallest on an on-time frame and the largest on a late frame. The deadline before a vblank lies between them |

## 3. What each section measures, and why the backend needs it

### 3.1 Environment (summary section 1)

X server vendor and release, screens, RandR CRTCs and outputs, mode
timings, providers, output properties, compositing manager, window
manager, 30-bit visuals, gamma ramp size, server extensions.

- The refresh rate is the dot clock divided by htotal x vtotal, to six
  decimals. The backend's fixed-grid capability needs the exact period.
  The vblank test compares it with the UST fit (ppm).
- The provider name tells the DDX: `modesetting` or the amdgpu driver.
  Their page-flip behavior differs (amdgpu has `TearFree` and
  `VariableRefresh` options).
- Output properties include `vrr_capable`, `TearFree`, `max bpc` and the
  EDID's monitor name. `max bpc` and the 30-bit visual count say whether
  10-bit output is possible.
- `_NET_WM_CM_Sn` has an owner when a compositing manager runs on screen
  n. A compositor forces the copy path unless it unredirects the
  window. The probe sets `_NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR` on its fullscreen
  windows.
- DRI3 and Present present means Mesa presents through Present. Only
  then are Present events the per-frame path report.

### 3.2 GLX_OML_sync_control and the clocks (section 2)

- Presence of OML, swap control, `GLX_INTEL_swap_event`,
  `GLX_EXT_create_context_es2_profile`; the 10 bpc FBConfigs.
- Whether GLX gives a GL ES 3.0 context. rig_spec decides GL ES 3.0
  only. If GLX cannot make one, the backend uses EGL and takes its
  timing from Present instead of OML.
- `glXGetSyncValuesOML` 200 times with `clock_gettime` after each read,
  on `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, `_RAW`, `REALTIME` and `BOOTTIME`. For each
  clock and unit (us, ns) the probe counts the reads where "read time
  minus UST" lies between 0 and about one period, and names the first
  clock that fits 95% of them. The backend can use a UST as a
  `ysp/rt.h` time without correlation only if it is
  `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`.
- `glXGetMscRateOML` and the MSC rate from the reads, against the mode.
- PresentNotifyMSC: 300 events queued at once, one per vblank. They
  give an independent vblank grid (the Linux analog of the scanline
  source in screen.md), the UST jitter about a straight-line fit, the
  same clock test, and the delay from the vblank to the event's
  arrival. That delay bounds how soon `yscr_begin()` can complete a
  record.

### 3.3 GLX swaps, fullscreen (section 3)

One override-redirect window covers the X screen: Xorg's Present
code flips a window only when it covers the whole screen (from the
Xorg source; the output control below checks it). Every run starts
after 10 swaps and a fresh vblank anchor. Runs:

| Run | What it does | Question |
|---|---|---|
| `oml_k1`, `oml_k2`, `oml_k3` | `glXSwapBuffersMscOML(target = last shown + k)`, then `glXWaitForSbcOML` | Does a target MSC hold a frame exactly? This is the scheduling primitive that `yscr_flip_at()` needs |
| `swap_wait` | `glXSwapBuffers`, swap interval 1, then wait | The depth: on which vblank does an unscheduled swap show? |
| `swap_pipe` | `glXSwapBuffers` with no wait | The queue the driver allows, the swap call's blocking, and latency without a wait |
| `sleep_k2` | Sleep until 1 ms after vblank target-1, then swap | The method DXGI_FLIP uses (screen.md, "Holding a frame"), for EGL where no target MSC exists |
| `vblwait_k2` | Wait for a PresentNotifyMSC event at target-1, then swap | The same hold with the server's vblank event as the wake |
| `oml_k1_late` | `oml_k1`, and every 30th frame spins 1.25 periods before its swap | Does the reported onset move with a late frame (an observation, tier 1) or stay on the plan (tier 3)? Are late frames flagged and no others? |

Each swap records OML's values for that swap, its PresentCompleteNotify
(the path: flip, copy, suboptimal copy, skip) and its INTEL event if the
extension exists. The serial check ("Present serial equals the swap
count") confirms that the probe matched each event to its swap.

Controls, after the fullscreen runs:

- A 640 x 480 window: the server must copy it. If the path report shows
  copy here and flip fullscreen, the report tells the paths apart.
- When one X screen has two or more active CRTCs: a window that covers
  only the first output. It shows whether a per-output window can flip,
  which rig_spec's "one window per output" design needs.

### 3.4 Present (section 4)

The Present columns of every run, and the vblank test. Mesa's DRI3
path presents with PresentPixmap on its own connection. The probe opens
a second connection and selects PresentCompleteNotify on the same
window; the server sends each selecting client its own event. If the
Present columns stay empty, Mesa did not use Present (DRI2) and the
summary says so.

### 3.5 EGL on X11 (section 5)

The same runs, without OML, through the system `libEGL.so.1` on
`EGL_PLATFORM_X11_KHR` with `EGL_PLATFORM_X11_SCREEN_KHR`, a GL ES 3.0
context and swap interval 1. It reports the EGL extensions that could
carry present timing: `EGL_CHROMIUM_sync_control`,
`EGL_ANDROID_get_frame_timestamps`, `EGL_ANDROID_presentation_time`,
`EGL_EXT_present_opaque`, and others. Its timing comes from the Present
events.

With `--angle DIR`, the same through ANGLE's Vulkan and GL back ends.
`GL_RENDERER` names the back end. ANGLE is optional on Linux; rig_spec
uses the native driver there.

### 3.6 Vulkan (section 6)

Extension listing only, no swapchain run: the device, the driver (RADV
expected), `VK_KHR_present_id`, `VK_KHR_present_wait`, their `2`
versions, `VK_GOOGLE_display_timing`, `VK_EXT_present_timing`,
`VK_EXT_acquire_xlib_display`, `VK_EXT_direct_mode_display`,
`VK_KHR_display`, the present modes and 10 bpc formats for an X11
window on the screen, and the displays that `VK_KHR_display` lists.

### 3.7 Two X screens (section 7)

Each screen gets its own X connection (`:0.N`) and thread, as a backend
that takes `desc.x_display` would. Four phases of `oml_k1` (or
`swap_wait` without OML), each about 10 s:

| Phase | Screen 0 | Screen 1 |
|---|---|---|
| A | timed | idle |
| B | idle | timed |
| C | timed | timed |
| D | timed | untimed: swap interval 0, as fast as it goes |

Compare screen 0's rows of A, C and D: a change in late frames, MSC
steps, grid residual or swap call time means one screen disturbs the
other. D is rig_spec 4.2's untimed operator screen. Phase C also
reports the onset offset between the screens and its drift: CRTCs that
are not locked drift.

### 3.8 SDL3 on a non-default screen (section 8)

Each variant runs in a child process, so an SDL crash costs only that
variant. It prints the displays SDL lists, the X screen the window is
on (from the X server, not only SDL's property), and whether a GL
context works:

| Variant | DISPLAY | SDL display | Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1, 2 | default | index 0 | GLX; EGL ES 3.0 |
| 3, 4 | `<display>.1` | index 0 | GLX; EGL ES 3.0 |
| 5, 6 | default | index 1 (on screen 1, if SDL lists it) | GLX; EGL ES 3.0 |

Expectation from reading SDL3's source (commit 0359c2d41, 2025-08-22),
not measured: SDL lists the RandR outputs of every X screen and creates
a window on its display's screen, but `X11_GL_CreateContext` picks its
FBConfig on `DefaultScreen()`. So variant 5 may fail or mismatch, while
variant 3 should work. The EGL path picks the visual on the window's
screen. The 2.0-era reports in rig_spec do not apply to SDL3 as is.

### 3.9 Load (section 9)

Pass 2 of `run.sh` runs `--quick` with one busy thread per CPU and the
heavy shader. Compare its late frames and grid residuals with pass 1.

## 4. What the results will decide

1. **Scheduling primitive.** If `oml_k2` and `oml_k3` show every frame
   on its target, `yscr_flip_at()` passes the planned vblank as
   `glXSwapBuffersMscOML`'s target. If not, the backend holds frames by
   `sleep` or by `vblwait`, whichever was exact.
2. **Context API.** GLX ES 3.0 with OML, or EGL ES 3.0 with Present
   events. This follows from item 1 and from whether GLX made an ES 3.0
   context.
3. **Onset source and tier.** OML's UST or Present's UST. Tier 1 needs:
   the UST is `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (no correlation), it sits on the
   NotifyMSC grid, it moves with a late frame (`oml_k1_late`), and the
   path is flip. The arrival delay sets when a record can complete.
4. **Path detection.** If the Present mode is flip fullscreen and copy
   in the window control, `record.mode` takes it from Present per frame,
   and a copy frame gets a lower tier. INTEL_swap_event is the fallback
   where Present is absent.
5. **Depth and slack.** `swap_wait`'s MSC steps give the depth; the
   slack columns give the deadline before a vblank for the evidence
   rule of screen.md ("Depth on a backend that holds frames").
6. **Two-screen design.** Whether the backend opens its own X
   connection per screen (`desc.x_display`) or SDL3 can do it
   (section 8). Whether an untimed operator screen is safe beside a
   timed one (phase D). Whether one window per output can flip on a
   single X screen (the output control).
7. **10-bit output.** 30-bit visuals, 10 bpc FBConfigs or EGL configs,
   `max bpc`, Vulkan 10 bpc formats, and the gamma ramp size. On Xorg,
   30-bit visuals are normally offered only when the server runs at
   depth 30.
8. **VRR safety.** `_VARIABLE_REFRESH` on the window (Mesa sets it when
   its `adaptive_sync` driconf option is on), `vrr_capable`, and the
   Xorg log. The backend must keep variable refresh off by default
   (rig_spec 4.2).

## 5. Results (template)

### 5.6 Decisions

One line per item of section 4, with the numbers it rests on.

## 6. Checked, and not verified

Checked on 2026-10-09 in WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04, Mesa 23.2.1, gcc 11.4 and
clang 11), with a private two-screen Xvfb. No WSLg window was used, so
that no fullscreen window covered the Windows desktop during other
measurements. These runs check the code paths, not timing: Xvfb has a
simulated 60 Hz vblank and no display.

- Builds without warnings with `-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wpedantic` on
  both compilers, with and without the Vulkan headers.
- `run.sh` end to end: build, system files, both passes, the archive.
- Under ASan and UBSan: no error in a full pass with two screens. The
  leak report lists Mesa's allocations and one deliberate one: the
  probe keeps each EGL library loaded.
- PresentNotifyMSC, the clock test and the two-screen phases ran.
  Xvfb's UST matched `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` in microseconds on 60 of 60
  events.
- Mesa 23.2's `eglGetMscRateANGLE` crashed on its software X11 path.
  The probe now calls it only on ANGLE. The first call of each optional
  sync query runs under a fault handler, and a context whose driver
  crashed is abandoned, not closed: after a crash, the driver's and
  Xlib's locks can still be held, and closing deadlocked.

Not verified:

- Neither Xvfb nor WSLg has DRI3, so GL swaps made no Present events.
  The PresentCompleteNotify path for swaps (event to swap matching, the
  serial check, the mode counts) has not run.
- OML, INTEL_swap_event, swap interval control, SDL3 and ANGLE were
  absent in WSL, so their paths have not run.
- Whether Present delivers a second client's selection on Mesa's window
  on the rig's server. Section 3.4 reads the Present protocol; the run
  will show it.
- The two-screen phases with real vblanks, and `--wm` with a real
  window manager.
- That `XResetScreenSaver` also holds off DPMS on the rig's server.
