# The pack: format, reader and tool

Status: built, 2026-10-08. Phase 1 settled the decisions that rig_spec 5
left open (the coordinator approved them, with the recommendations of
section 10 as defaults); phase 2 built them: `include/ysp/pack.h` v0.1.0
(the reader), `pack/ysp/pack_tool.h` v0.1.0 (the tool library) and the
`ypak` CLI. Section 9.1 has the phase 1 probes and the phase 2
measurements. Where the build changed the design, the text says so. When
this page and rig_spec 5 disagree, this page is newer.

Settled before this page, in rig_spec 5, and not reopened here: one zip
file in store-only mode; entries aligned to 4 KB; readable by any zip
tool; a browser reads the central directory from the tail and then only
the entries it needs, by HTTP range; compression per resource, never on
the container; the pack can be appended to the player executable; a
manifest with a format version and, per entry, a checksum, the source
file's hash, the tool version and the exact derivation; the runtime
refuses an unknown format version; canonical in-memory forms equal the
on-disk forms (audio is widened to float at load).

## 1. Summary of the decisions

| Question | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| zip64 | Yes, only where a value does not fit 32 bits (APPNOTE 4.3.9.2) | A two-hour film is 7.2 GB at 8 Mbit/s. Six zip readers read a 4.4 GB stored zip64 entry (measured, 3.3). |
| Alignment | Android's alignment extra field (0xD935) in the local header pads each entry's data to 4096 | No gaps between entries, so streaming readers work. Six readers accept it (measured). |
| Appended to an executable | The tool pads the executable to 4096 and writes absolute offsets in the copy | .NET refuses offsets relative to the zip start; every reader accepts absolute ones (measured). |
| Entry order | `ysp/manifest.json` first, then every other entry in bytewise name order | A streaming reader sees the manifest first. Sorted names give lookup by binary search and a duplicate check in one pass. |
| Names | The reader accepts safe UTF-8. The tool writes a portable ASCII set, unique without regard to case | Extraction is safe on every file system; a later tool can widen the set and old readers still open its packs. |
| Runtime checksum | XXH64 over 1 MiB chunks, then over the list of chunk hashes | 10 to 12 GB/s native and in WebAssembly; on the cold and mapped paths XXH3 is only 10 to 12 % faster; ysp/video.h already uses XXH64. |
| Citable hashes | SHA-256 of every entry and every source, in the manifest. The pack ID is the SHA-256 of the manifest | Standard tools compute SHA-256. The ID is the same for the pack alone and for its appended copy. |
| zip CRC-32 | Written, checked by `ypak verify`, not checked at run time | Zip requires it. Slice-by-8 runs at 2.5 to 3.0 GB/s natively and 1.5 to 1.8 GB/s in WebAssembly. |
| Manifest | JSON, first entry, keys sorted, integers only, reals as decimal strings, no compiler named | People, Python and the browser read it without ysp code. The reader header does not parse it. One fixed form makes the bytes deterministic. |
| What the reader needs | A 32-byte private extra field (0x7379) in each central directory record: kind, flags, data offset, XXH64, chunk index | The reader gets everything from the central directory, which a browser fetches in one or two requests. |
| Format version | In the zip comment and in the manifest; they must agree | The reader finds it without JSON. |
| Reader header | `include/ysp/pack.h`, prefix `ypak_`, in the `ysp::core` group | It needs no SDL and no GL; file mapping is the OS's. |
| Tool | Library `pack/ysp/pack_tool.h` (prefix `ypt_`), CLI `ypak` | |
| Source description | JSON. The manifest is the source description plus the results | `ypak rebuild` uses the manifest as its input. |
| Rebuild check | Check every source's SHA-256, rebuild, then compare byte for byte | The same inputs and tool version give the same bytes (section 7); MSVC, MinGW, emcc and Linux gcc builds of the tool gave the same bytes on 213 MB of corpus (9.1). |

## 2. Reference: the container

A pack is a zip file (APPNOTE 6.3.10) with the profile below. The reader
refuses a file that is outside the profile, with a message that names the
field and the tool that writes a correct pack. File extension:
`.ysppak`.

### 2.1 Layout

```
[ executable, padded with zeros to a multiple of 4096 ]   only in an appended copy
local header 0   "ysp/manifest.json"   extra: [zip64] 0xD935 padding
data 0           at a multiple of 4096 from the zip start
local header 1   next name in bytewise order
data 1
...
local header n-1
data n-1
central directory   n records, same order, each with the 0x7379 record
[ zip64 end record, zip64 locator ]      only when needed
end of central directory record, comment "ysp-pack/1 ..."
```

- There are no gaps. Local header i + 1 starts at the end of data i. The
  central directory starts at the end of the last entry's data. The
  reader checks this, so the only bytes that no hash covers are the
  zero padding (checked) and the comment (fixed syntax).
- "The zip start" is the offset of local header 0 in the file: 0 for a
  pack alone, the padded executable size for an appended copy.

### 2.2 Fixed fields

Every field below has one value, so the container bytes follow from the
entries alone (section 7).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Compression method | 0 (stored) |
| General purpose flags | 0x0800 (UTF-8 names). Bit 0 (encryption) and bit 3 (data descriptor) are refused |
| Version needed | 20; 45 when the entry has a zip64 field |
| Version made by | 0x0314 (UNIX, 2.0); 0x032D when zip64 |
| DOS time, date | 0, 0x0021 (1980-01-01 00:00) |
| CRC-32 | of the data, in both headers |
| Sizes | compressed = uncompressed; 0xFFFFFFFF in both header fields and the real sizes in the zip64 field when size >= 0xFFFFFFFF |
| Internal and external attributes | 0, and 0100644 << 16 (a regular file, rw-r--r--) |
| Disk numbers | 0 |
| File comment | none |
| Other extra fields | none (no timestamps, no UID or GID) |

### 2.3 zip64

The tool writes zip64 fields only where APPNOTE requires them:

- An entry of 0xFFFFFFFF bytes or more: a zip64 field in its local header
  with both sizes (APPNOTE 4.5.3), and in its central record with both
  sizes.
- A local header offset of 0xFFFFFFFF or more: that offset in the central
  record's zip64 field, after any sizes.
- A central directory offset of 0xFFFFFFFF or more, or 65535 entries or
  more: the zip64 end record and locator. The end record then holds
  0xFFFFFFFF or 0xFFFF in the fields that overflow.

The rule depends only on sizes and offsets, so the output is the same
every time. The reader accepts the zip64 field whenever it is present and
checks that its values agree with the 32-bit fields that do not overflow.

### 2.4 Alignment

The local header's extra field ends with Android's alignment record
(APPNOTE extra field list: 0xD935, "Android ZIP Alignment Extra Field"):

| Bytes | Value |
|---|---|
| 2 | 0xD935 |
| 2 | 2 + p |
| 2 | 4096, the alignment |
| p | zeros |

p is the smallest value that puts the data at a multiple of 4096 from the
zip start. The record is at least 6 bytes, so p can be 0 and is at most
4095. The central directory carries no padding.

Why 4096 holds in memory too: the reader maps the whole file (2.10). A
mapping starts on a page boundary, so data that is 4096-aligned in the
file is 4096-aligned in memory. Apple silicon and some Linux arm64
kernels have 16 KB or 64 KB pages; whole-file mapping makes that
irrelevant. Unbuffered I/O (512 or 4096-byte sectors) works on entry
boundaries.

### 2.5 The private central directory record (0x7379)

Each central directory record carries this extra field after any zip64
field. 0x7379 is not in APPNOTE 6.3.10's list of header IDs. Zip tools
skip it.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 2 | 0x7379 |
| 2 | 2 | 28, the data size (the record is 32 bytes) |
| 4 | 1 | record version, 1 |
| 5 | 1 | 0 |
| 6 | 2 | kind (2.11) |
| 8 | 4 | flags: bit 0 STREAM (read through a cursor, verified per chunk); other bits 0 |
| 12 | 8 | data offset from the zip start |
| 20 | 8 | entry hash (2.8) |
| 28 | 4 | index of the entry's first hash in `ysp/chunks`, or 0xFFFFFFFF for an entry of at most one chunk |

The data offset lets a browser fetch an entry with one range request
from the central directory alone. The reader checks it against the local
header (30 + name + extra) when it first reads the entry.

### 2.6 The comment

The end record's comment is ASCII, one line, no line end:

```
ysp-pack/1 manifest=sha256:<64 hex> cd=xxh64:<16 hex>
```

- `1` is the format version. The reader refuses any other value: "pack
  format 2; this player reads format 1; update the player".
- `manifest=` is the pack ID (2.8).
- `cd=` is the XXH64 (seed 0) of the central directory bytes. A zip tool
  that changes the pack keeps the comment and changes the directory, so
  the reader then refuses the pack: "the central directory does not match
  its hash; was the pack changed by another zip tool? Rebuild it with
  ypak".

### 2.7 Names

Reader rule (what any pack may contain): valid UTF-8 (no overlong forms,
no surrogates), 1 to 1024 bytes, no byte below 0x20, no 0x7F, no `\`, no
`/` at the start or end, no empty component, no `.` or `..` component.
The tool's `extract` applies the writer rule to every name before it
writes a file.

Writer rule (what the phase 2 tool writes): components of `A`-`Z`,
`a`-`z`, `0`-`9`, `.`, `_`, `-`, joined by `/`; a component does not
start with `.` and does not end with `.`; a component is not a Windows
device name (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1 to COM9, LPT1 to LPT9, with or
without an extension); each component at most 255 bytes; no two names
equal after ASCII case folding.

Lookup is exact, byte for byte, and case-sensitive. When a lookup fails,
the reader's message names a case-insensitive match if one exists.

Reserved: names that start with `ysp/` are the format's own entries
(`ysp/manifest.json`, `ysp/chunks`). The tool refuses them in a source
description.

The extension of a name states its canonical form (2.11), for example
`faces/f01.ysptex`, not `faces/f01.png`. The manifest records the source
path, so a script that names the source can be resolved.

### 2.8 Hashes and the pack ID

| Hash | Over | Where | Checked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRC-32 (zip) | each entry's data | both zip headers | `ypak verify`, any zip tool (`unzip -t`) |
| XXH64 chunk hashes | each 1 MiB chunk of an entry, seed 0 | `ysp/chunks` (entries of two or more chunks) | the reader, per chunk, on first read |
| Entry hash | XXH64, seed = entry size, over the entry's chunk hashes as little-endian u64 | 0x7379 record; manifest | the reader, per entry |
| SHA-256 | each entry's data; each source file | manifest | `ypak verify`, `ypak rebuild`, `sha256sum` on extracted files |
| Pack ID | SHA-256 of the bytes of `ysp/manifest.json` | comment; printed by `ypak info`; logged by the player | the reader at open |
| Directory hash | XXH64 of the central directory | comment | the reader at open |

- An entry of k chunks has chunk hashes c_0 to c_(k-1), where k =
  max(1, ceil(size / 2^20)) and an empty entry has one empty chunk. The
  entry hash is the same function for every size, so one code path checks
  a whole entry and a streamed one.
- The manifest lists the SHA-256 of every other entry, so the pack ID
  commits to every byte of every entry. The container bytes follow from
  the entries (2.2), and `ypak verify` checks that the container is the
  canonical one.
- None of these hashes is a signature. They find corruption, not
  forgery, as in ysp/table.h. A pack from another lab is checked for
  memory safety, not for authenticity (rig_spec 6, sandbox).

`ysp/chunks`, kind CHUNKS:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | "YSPCHNK1" |
| 8 | 4 | version, 1 |
| 12 | 4 | log2 of the chunk size, 20 |
| 16 | 8 | n, the number of hashes |
| 24 | 8 | 0 |
| 32 | 8 n | chunk hashes, little-endian, entry by entry in pack order |

The reader verifies `ysp/chunks` and the manifest whole at open; their
records have no chunk index, whatever their size. (Changed in phase 2:
the first page gave the manifest a chunk list like any entry, which is
circular for a manifest past 1 MiB, about 2500 entries, because the
manifest lists the chunk table's hash.) A 7.2 GB film adds 55 KB.

### 2.9 Limits

| Limit | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Entries | 1 to 1,048,576 | The index is 32 bytes an entry (32 MB at the limit). |
| Name | 1024 bytes, 255 a component | Portable path limits. |
| Central directory | 256 MiB | Bounds the reader's one allocation. |
| Entry and pack size | below 2^62 bytes | Offsets plus sizes never overflow int64. |
| Comment | the line of 2.6, at most 255 bytes | |

### 2.10 Hostile input

The player opens packs from other labs. The reader treats every byte as
hostile:

- The end record is searched for in the last 65,557 bytes only (22 bytes
  plus the largest comment). The zip64 locator and end record must agree
  with it.
- Every offset and size is checked in 64-bit arithmetic with overflow
  checks before use. Every extra field is walked with its length bounded
  by the record.
- Entry count, central directory size and offset agree between the end
  record, the zip64 record and the walk.
- Every rule of 2.2 to 2.7 is checked: method, flags, version needed,
  sizes, names, order (strictly ascending after entry 0, which also
  refuses duplicates), contiguity, alignment, the 0x7379 record, the
  comment.
- On first access to an entry, the reader checks its local header
  against the central record (signature, name bytes, CRC, sizes, method,
  flags, extra length) and that the padding is zeros (libzip's
  consistency check does the first part).
- Every kind's header (section 4) is bounds-checked by its view function
  before a pointer leaves the reader. The deep checks of a form stay with
  its owner (`ytb_view()`, `ygfx_cset_check()`, `ycol_cal` checks,
  ysp/audio.h's WAV parser, `yvid` index checks).
- `tests/fuzz/pack_fuzz.c` (libFuzzer, as `table_fuzz.c`): its input is a
  pack in memory; it opens it, looks up every name and random ones, reads
  every entry whole and through a cursor, runs every view, and repeats the
  open through the incremental path (2.12) with the bytes in pieces. The
  test also flips every bit of a small pack and truncates it at every
  length: each result is refused or reads correct data.

### 2.11 Kinds

| Id | Kind | Extension | Canonical form | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MANIFEST | `ysp/manifest.json` | section 3 | 2 |
| 2 | CHUNKS | `ysp/chunks` | 2.8 | 2 |
| 3 | EXPERIMENT | any | opaque bytes; the manifest names the media type | 2 |
| 4 | FILE | any | opaque bytes (a license, a readme, data a script reads) | 2 |
| 5 | TABLE | `.pstb` | ysp/table.h's PSTB block | 2 |
| 6 | CALIBRATION | `.yspcal` | ysp/color.h's `ycol_cal`, 62528 bytes | 2, see open question 1 |
| 7 | FONT | `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.ttc` | the font file, unchanged | 2 |
| 8 | CURVESET | `.yspcset` | curve set format v1 (docs/gfx.md) in a container | 2 |
| 9 | GLYPHRUNS | `.ysprun` | laid-out text blocks | 2 |
| 10 | ARTWORK | `.yspart` | layers over a curve set | 2 |
| 11 | AUDIO | `.wav` | WAV at the project rate | 2 |
| 12 | SHADER | `.yspshd` | the fragment body, mode and reflection | 2 |
| 13 | TEXTURE | `.ysptex` | ysp/gfx.h planes, raw or QOI | 2 |
| 14 | VIDEO | `.mpg`, `.mp4` | the media file, CFR, closed GOPs, no B-frames | 3 |
| 15 | VIDEO_INDEX | `.yspvi` | ysp/video.h's index | 3 |
| 16 | FRAMESEQ | `.yspvseq` | ysp/video.h's frame sequence | 3 |
| 17 | ALPHA | `.yspalpha` | exact alpha coverage at stated sizes | 3 |
| 18 | SCRIPT | | reserved (Luau source and bytecode) | later |
| 19 | EXTENSION | | reserved (native modules by hash, rig_spec 12) | later |

The reader refuses a kind it does not know (principle 4). Adding a kind
raises the format version.

### 2.12 Reader API: `include/ysp/pack.h` (`ypak_`, `YPAK_`)

A single header in the house style: C99 floor (it builds as C99, C11 and
C++17), no dependency, private XXH64, SHA-256 and CRC-32, nothing
allocated after open. The header's manual is the reference; in short:

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ypak_open(&pk, &desc)` | Opens from `desc.path` (mapped whole), `desc.data` (memory, 8-byte aligned), `desc.reader` (bytes by range) or `desc.tail` (incremental). Returns 0, `YPAK_NEED`, or a negative `YPAK_ERR_*` with the message in `ypak_error()` |
| `ypak_feed(&pk, bytes, n)` | Incremental open: exactly the range `pk.need_off`, `pk.need_len` asked for; `YPAK_NEED` again or 0 |
| `ypak_find`, `ypak_find_n`, `ypak_at`, `ypak_first_of` | Lookup by name (binary search), by index, by kind (the EXPERIMENT) |
| `ypak_data(&pk, &e)` | The entry's bytes, zero-copy, checked and verified by the policy; NULL without a mapping or memory |
| `ypak_check(&pk, &e, bytes, n)` | Checks bytes the caller fetched: exactly `[header_off, data_off + size)` |
| `ypak_cursor_init`, `ypak_cursor_read` | A stream: `ypak_cursor_read` has the signature of `yau_reader.read` and `yvid_reader.read`; verifies each 1 MiB chunk on its first read |
| `ypak_verify_all` | Every entry now (a preflight) |
| `ypak_id`, `ypak_describe` | `sha256:<hex>`, and one log line that names the policy |
| `ypak_xxh64*`, `ypak_entry_hash`, `ypak_sha256*`, `ypak_crc32` | The hashes, for the tool and for callers |
| `ypak_cset_view`, `ypak_art_view`, `ypak_runs_view` (`ypak_runs_find`, `ypak_runs_str`), `ypak_shader_view`, `ypak_texture_view`, `ypak_qoi_decode`, `ypak_qoi_encode` | The pack's own forms (section 4): bounds of their headers only |
| `ypak_name_ok` | The reader's name rule (2.7) |

- **A path** (`YPAK_FILE`, on unless `YPAK_NO_FILE`): one read-only
  mapping of the whole file (`CreateFileMappingW` and `MapViewOfFile` at
  offset 0, the path converted from UTF-8; `mmap` on POSIX). Windows maps
  views only at 64 KB offsets, so per-entry views are not used.
- **Memory**: the whole pack, 8-byte aligned; entry data is then at least
  8-byte aligned, and 4096-aligned when the base is.
- **A range reader**: the reader copies the central directory and the
  chunk table at open. A cursor needs scratch of `min(size, 1 MiB)` and
  reads whole chunks into it.
- **Incremental** (the browser): open with the file's last bytes (64 KB
  or more); the call asks for the central directory if the tail lacks it,
  then the manifest's range, then the chunk table's. The reader does no
  I/O. A tail of the whole file opens in one call.
- **Memory use**: at open, 56 bytes an entry for the index and one flag
  byte per entry and per chunk, plus the central directory and the chunk
  table without a mapping: from `desc.arena`, or one `YPAK_MALLOC` each.
  With an arena that is too small, open returns `YPAK_ERR_FULL` with
  `pk.need`. Nothing after open (the bench counts 0).
- **Threads**: after open, any number of threads may call the lookups,
  `ypak_data()`, `ypak_check()` and their own cursors. Verified flags are
  bytes set with release semantics. `ypak_error()` holds the last failure
  of any thread.
- **Frame budget**: nothing in the reader runs on the frame thread after
  load except lookups (0.06 to 0.14 us measured, section 8). The player
  calls `ypak_data()` at load. A cursor verifies on the thread that reads,
  a decode or producer thread; one chunk costs 0.27 ms there (section 8).
- **Not built**: finding the pack before an Authenticode certificate
  table (open question 10). A pack must end at its file's end.

## 3. Reference: the manifest

`ysp/manifest.json`, kind MANIFEST, entry 0, with no chunk list (it is
hashed whole at open). UTF-8 JSON (RFC 8259) in one fixed form (section
7): keys in bytewise order at every level. ysp/json.h reads every
description and manifest and writes this form (its YJS_WRITE_PRETTY,
docs/json.md). It is the source description
(section 5) plus what the build computed. An abridged example from the
test corpus:

```json
{
  "audio": {
    "channels": 2,
    "rate": 48000
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "crc32": "...",
      "derivation": {
        "allow_empty": false,
        "by": "ysp/table.h 0.1.0",
        "delimiter": ",",
        "op": "csv",
        "types": {
          "word": "string"
        }
      },
      "kind": "table",
      "name": "conditions.pstb",
      "sha256": "...",
      "size": 400,
      "sources": [

        }
      ],
      "xxh64": "..."
    }
  ],

    "media_type": "application/vnd.ysp.experiment"
  },
  "format": "ysp-pack",
  "tool": {
    "libraries": {
      "layout": "ylay 0.1.0 skribidi dee63d6ba76aeddd49dea6d1b2508cf9aa391f46 sha256:ff058faa...,sha256:36ce7aec... harfbuzz 14.6.0 sheenbidi ... libunibreak ... budouxc ...",
      "lodepng": "e584a8490db1b76b81bf298c11c09d3b55d9c270",
      "ysp/audio.h": "0.2.1",
      "ysp/color.h": "0.1.0",
      "ysp/gfx.h": "0.10.3",
      "ysp/json.h": "0.1.0",
      "ysp/outline.h": "0.2.1",
      "ysp/pack.h": "0.1.0",
      "ysp/table.h": "0.1.0"
    },
    "name": "ypak",
    "version": "0.1.1"
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

Rules:

- `version` equals the comment's version. The reader checks the comment;
  `ypak verify` checks both.
- `entries` lists every entry except the manifest, in pack order, with
  `ysp/chunks` included. `size`, `sha256`, `xxh64`, `crc32` and `stream`
  equal the container's (`ypak verify`).
- `sources`: each input file, by its path relative to the source
  description, `/` separators, and its SHA-256. `from`: entries of this
  pack that the entry is made from (a curve set's font, glyph runs' fonts).
- `derivation`: `op` (the step), `by` (the library and version that did
  it; for glyph runs, `ylay_stamp()`'s line with every font's SHA-256), and
  the parameters: the resource's keys from the source description plus the
  defaults the tool applied, so the record is complete without the tool's
  documentation. Some values are records only and are not taken back by a
  rebuild: `faces` and `fs_type` (font), `role` (calibration), `resolve`
  and `backward` (curve set), `contract` and `validated` (shader),
  `convert` (audio).
- Numbers are integers. A real-valued parameter is a JSON string with the
  decimal text the tool parsed (`"1e-4"`), read by ysp/table.h's
  locale-free, correctly rounded parser. The tool refuses a JSON number
  with a fraction or an exponent and says to write a string.
- Durations, where any appear, are in seconds (decided 2026-10-07).
- No time, date, host name, user name, absolute path, or compiler. These
  differ between builds of the same pack; leaving the compiler out keeps
  the pack ID the same for every build of one tool version whose entries
  agree (they do; section 9.1).
- `experiment`: the entry the player interprets and its media type
  (opaque, rig_spec 6). At most one entry has kind EXPERIMENT.
- `audio`: the project rate and channel count.
- `private: true`: the source description marked the pack private (open
  question 7).
- `license`: per entry, the SPDX expression the source description gives.

## 4. Reference: the kinds

Fields are little-endian; offsets are from the entry's start. The new
forms start with an 8-byte magic, a u32 version (1) and a u32 header size;
every section starts at a multiple of 16 and the entry's size is a
multiple of 16. "Pool" is a region of UTF-8 strings, each followed by a
NUL, named by offset and length. The views check exactly these fields;
the deep checks stay with each form's owner.

### 4.1 TABLE

The PSTB block (docs/table.md, format 1), unchanged; `ytb_view()` reads
it in place. Source: CSV or TSV through `ytb_csv()`. Parameters:
`delimiter` (`","`, `";"` or `"\t"`; default `","`), `types` (column name
to `"integer"`, `"number"` or `"string"`), `allow_empty` (default false).

### 4.2 CALIBRATION (decided 2026-10-09: open question 1)

The `.yspcal` file (62528 bytes), unchanged, loaded with
`ycol_cal_load()` before it is stored. The derivation records
`"role": "preview"`: a calibration in a pack is for preview and
simulation; the player never applies it on a rig. One function in the
tool (`calibration_role()`) decides this.

### 4.3 FONT (license rule decided 2026-10-09: open question 7)

The font file, unchanged: TrueType, CFF OpenType, or a collection of up
to 16 faces. Every face is opened with `yol_font_open()`. The tool reads
each face's OS/2 `fsType` and refuses a face marked restricted license
embedding (bits 0 to 3 equal 2) unless the source description sets
`"private": true`. One function in the tool (`font_license_ok()`) decides
this. The derivation records `faces` and face 0's `fs_type` (-1: no OS/2).

### 4.4 CURVESET

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | "YSPCSET1" |
| 8 | 4 | version 1 |
| 12 | 4 | header size 64 |
| 16 | 4 | units: 0 em (a font), 1 user units (artwork) |
| 20 | 4 | G, the glyph table size, below 2^24 |
| 24 | 4 | flags: bit 0, every glyph of the face is built |
| 28 | 4 | face |
| 32 | 8 | n_texels |
| 40 | 8 | n_words, a multiple of 4 |
| 48 | 8 | texels offset, 64 |
| 56 | 8 | words offset, 64 + 16 n_texels |
| 64 | | texels (4 f32 each), then words (u32): curve set format v1 (docs/gfx.md), the words starting 0x43505359, 1, G |

Parameters: `from` (the FONT entry), `face` (default 0), `glyphs`
(`"all"`, the default, or `"used"`: .notdef and the glyphs the pack's
glyph runs use from that face), `tol` (the CFF cubic tolerance in em,
default `"1e-4"`). Built resolved, with backward lists (as `pack/layout`
builds its sets), checked with `ygfx_cset_check()`. The view gives
pointers for `ygfx_cset_desc`; nothing is copied. Note that "YSPC", the
words' magic, is also the start of a `.yspcal` file; the kind, not the
bytes, says what an entry is.

### 4.5 GLYPHRUNS

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | "YSPGRUN1" |
| 8 | 4, 4 | version 1, header size 112 |
| 16 | 5 x 4 | n_fonts (at most 64), n_blocks, n_runs, n_items, n_lines |
| 36 | 4 | 0 |
| 40 | 8 x 8 | offsets of fonts, blocks, runs, items, clusters, lines, the pool; the pool's size |
| 104 | 8 | 0 |

Each section follows the one before at the next multiple of 16. Records:

- font, 16 bytes: the CURVESET entry's name and the FONT entry's name
  (pool offset and length each).
- block, 96 bytes: key, text, language (pool offset and length each);
  size, width, line height, color (f32); direction and alignment as given,
  the resolved direction (i32); n_missing (u32, always 0: the tool refuses
  text that a font lacks); w, h (f32); first run, run count, first item,
  item count, first line, line count (u32); 8 bytes 0. Blocks are sorted
  by key, keys unique.
- run, 16 bytes: font index, size (f32), first item (from the block's
  first item), count.
- item, 32 bytes: `ygfx_citem` as ysp/gfx.h takes it.
- cluster, 4 bytes per item: the codepoint offset where its cluster starts.
- line, 32 bytes: x, baseline, width, ascent, descent (f32), text start,
  text end (u32), 0.

Parameters: `fonts` (FONT entry names in fallback order, or
`{"font", "face"}`; each needs a CURVESET entry made from it), `blocks`
(`key`, `text`, `size` required; `width`, `line_height`, `color`, as
decimal strings, default `"0"`; `dir` `auto`, `ltr` or `rtl`; `align`
`start`, `end` or `center`; `lang`, BCP 47). Spans are not built yet.

### 4.6 ARTWORK

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | "YSPARTW1" |
| 8 | 4, 4 | version 1, header size 80 |
| 16 | 4 | n_layers |
| 20 | 4 | 0 |
| 24 | 4 x 8 | the viewBox: x, y, width, height (f64) |
| 56 | 8 | layers offset, 80 |
| 64 | 8 | curve set offset, 80 + 16 n_layers |
| 72 | 8 | curve set size; the entry ends with it |

A layer, 16 bytes: glyph id in the set, rgba (the file's sRGB color and
opacity, unconverted), source (1 fill, 2 stroke), element index. The
curve set is a CURVESET body with units 1. Parameter: `tol` (viewBox
units; `"0"`, the default, is 1e-4 of the viewBox's larger side).

### 4.7 AUDIO

A WAV file as ysp/audio.h reads it (RIFF, RF64 or BW64; 16-bit, 24-bit,
24 in 32, or 32-bit float; 1 channel or the project's count), at the
project rate. The tool parses it with `yau_wav_probe()` (ysp/audio.h
v0.2.1) and refuses a float sample that is not a number. Exact
conversions, recorded as `"convert"`: unsigned 8-bit to 16-bit, 32-bit
integers whose low byte is 0 to 24 in 32, 64-bit floats that are exact in
32-bit float to 32-bit float; the result is a canonical WAV (fmt and data
only). Anything else, and any rate other than the project's, is refused
with a message that says what to export. Parameter: `stream` (flag
STREAM).

### 4.8 SHADER

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | "YSPSHAD1" |
| 8 | 4, 4 | version 1, header size 64 |
| 16 | 4 | mode: 0 modulation, 1 color, 2 add (`ygfx_shader_mode`) |
| 20 | 4 | flags: bit 0 reads `ysp_time`, bit 1 reads `ysp_seed`, bit 2 validated by glslang (never set yet) |
| 24 | 4 | params: bit k for `ysp_param(k)` with a literal k; all ones when a k is not a literal |
| 28 | 4 | textures: bits for `ysp_tex0` to `ysp_tex2`, `ysp_utex0` |
| 32 | 4 | `YGFX_SHADER_CONTRACT` at build (ysp/gfx.h v0.10.3) |
| 36 | 4 | 0 |
| 40 | 8 | XXH64 of `ygfx_shader_wrap()`'s output at build |
| 48 | 4, 4 | body offset (64), body length |
| 56 | 4, 4 | name offset (right after the body's NUL), name length |

The body and the entry's name follow, each with a NUL. The player wraps
the body itself (`ygfx_pipeline()`); it refuses another contract version
and logs a different wrap hash. Parameter: `mode` (required).

### 4.9 TEXTURE

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 8 | "YSPTEXR1" |
| 8 | 4, 4 | version 1, header size 64 |
| 16 | 4, 4 | w, h (1 to 65536) |
| 24 | 4 | format: `ygfx_format`'s value (R8 1, RG8 2, RGBA8 3, R16F 4, RGBA16F 5, R32F 6, RGBA32F 7, R16UI 8) |
| 28 | 8 | `ygfx_encoding`'s bytes: matrix, range, transfer, primaries, siting, chroma_nearest, 0, 0 |
| 36 | 4 | compression: 0 raw, 1 QOI (RGBA8 only) |
| 40 | 8 | stored bytes |
| 48 | 8 | raw bytes (w h texel size) |
| 56 | 8 | XXH64 of the raw rows, tight, row 0 at the top |
| 64 | | the data |

R16F and RGBA16F are stored as f32 (what ysp/gfx.h takes). Source: PNG,
decoded by lodepng (pinned, `tools/vendor_pack.py`). Defaults by PNG
type: 8-bit gray to R8, gray and alpha to RG8, RGB, RGBA and palette to
RGBA8 (RGB gets alpha 255), 16-bit gray to R16UI (little-endian); 16-bit
color needs `"format": "rgba32f"` (k / 65535 as f32). A `format` that
would drop or round values is refused. `encoding`: `srgb` (the default
for 8-bit), `linear` or `device`; a 16-bit PNG has no default. An `iCCP`
chunk, a `gAMA` other than 45455 and a `cHRM` other than sRGB's are
refused by name. `compression`: `raw` (default) or `qoi`; the reader's
`ypak_qoi_decode()` checks the raw hash.

### 4.10 VIDEO, VIDEO_INDEX, FRAMESEQ (phase 3, not built)

The design of the first page stands: the media file unchanged with flag
STREAM, the `.yspvi` index from `yvid_index_make()`, a `YSPVSEQ1` file
unchanged; ffmpeg's argument vector and version recorded. The reader
already reads these kinds (a cursor feeds `yvid_desc.reader`); the tool
refuses them.

### 4.11 ALPHA (phase 3, not built)

Exact alpha coverage at stated sizes; the form follows the first
experiment that needs it.

### 4.12 EXPERIMENT and FILE

Bytes, unchanged. The experiment comes from the description's top-level
`"experiment": {"entry", "source", "media_type"}`.

## 5. Reference: the tool

### 5.1 Library and CLI

`pack/ysp/pack_tool.h`, `pack/pack_tool.c` and `pack/pack_impl.c` (prefix
`ypt_`), a C11 library in the pack tool's tree beside `pack/layout`.
`pack_impl.c` compiles the implementations of ysp/pack.h, ysp/json.h,
ysp/table.h, ysp/outline.h, ysp/gfx.h (without SDL: the shader wrapper
and the curve set check), ysp/color.h, ysp/audio.h (without miniaudio:
the WAV probe) and ysp/rt.h once, so a program that links the library
defines none of them. It also links `pack/layout` (Skribidi) and lodepng (compiled as C
from a copy, its warnings off). CMake: `YSP_BUILD_PACK=ON`, which needs
`YSP_BUILD_LAYOUT=ON` and `third_party/lodepng/`; configure stops with
the fetch command (`uv run --no-project python tools/vendor_pack.py
--write`) when it is missing. It builds with MSVC, MinGW, Linux gcc and
emcc, so the designer can run the same code in the browser (the tool
test passes under node).

`ypak`, the CLI (`pack/ypak.c`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ypak build SRC.json -o OUT.ysppak` | Builds a pack from a source description |
| `ypak verify PACK` | Every check: structure, canonical container, CRC-32, XXH64 tree, SHA-256 per entry against the manifest, the manifest against the 0x7379 records, the pack ID. Exit 0 only when all pass |
| `ypak list PACK` | Name, kind, size, data offset, flags |
| `ypak info PACK` | Pack ID, format, tool, experiment, project audio |
| `ypak extract PACK [NAME...] -C DIR` | Writes entries, applying the writer's name rule; does not overwrite without `--force` |
| `ypak cat PACK NAME` | One entry to standard output |
| `ypak rebuild PACK --sources DIR [-o OUT]` | 5.3; a pack appended to a program is refused (rebuild the pack it was made from) |
| `ypak append PLAYER PACK -o OUT` | Pads the player to 4096, appends the pack with absolute offsets, rewrites the comment's directory hash. The pack ID does not change. A pack already appended is refused |

Exit codes: 0, 1 with the message on standard error, 2 for a usage
error. Every write goes to a temporary file that is renamed at the end,
so a failed build leaves no pack.

### 5.2 The source description

JSON in the manifest's form, without the computed fields (`size`,
`sha256`, `xxh64`, `crc32`, `sources[].sha256`, `tool`). A resource
gives its parameters as its own keys; the manifest moves them under
`derivation`, adds `op`, `by` and the defaults, and `ypak rebuild` moves
them back. The designer
writes it; a person can too. Names default to the source path with the
kind's extension.

```json
{
  "format": "ysp-pack-source",
  "version": 1,
  "experiment": { "entry": "experiment/main.json", "source": "main.json",
                  "media_type": "application/vnd.ysp.experiment" },
  "audio": { "rate": 48000, "channels": 2 },
  "resources": [
    { "name": "conditions.pstb", "kind": "table", "source": "conditions.csv",
      "csv": { "delimiter": ",", "types": { "contrast": "number" } } },
    { "name": "fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf", "kind": "font", "source": "fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf",
      "license": "OFL-1.1" },
    { "name": "fonts/NotoSans-Regular.yspcset", "kind": "curveset",
      "from": "fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf", "glyphs": "all" },
    { "name": "text/pages.ysprun", "kind": "glyphruns", "fonts": ["fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf"],
      "blocks": [ { "key": "intro", "text": "Press a key to start.", "size": "32", "width": "800", "lang": "en" } ] },
    { "name": "art/fixation.yspart", "kind": "artwork", "source": "art/fixation.svg" },
    { "name": "audio/beep.wav", "kind": "audio", "source": "audio/beep.wav" },
    { "name": "shaders/plaid.yspshd", "kind": "shader", "source": "shaders/plaid.glsl", "mode": "modulation" },
    { "name": "faces/f01.ysptex", "kind": "texture", "source": "faces/f01.png", "compression": "qoi" }
  ]
}
```

The JSON reader is strict (RFC 8259, depth and size bounds, duplicate keys
refused, unknown keys refused by name) and is fuzzed like the reader.

### 5.3 The rebuild check

A methods section cites the pack ID. A reviewer checks it:

1. Get the sources and the `ypak` release that the manifest names
   (`tool.version`, `tool.build`).
2. `ypak rebuild PACK --sources DIR`. The tool reads the manifest, checks
   the SHA-256 of each source and names the first that differs, runs every
   derivation again, writes a new pack, and compares it with the original
   byte for byte. It prints `identical` or the first entry and offset that
   differ, and exits 0 only on `identical`.
3. An `exec` step (ffmpeg) runs again only when the same program version
   is present; otherwise the tool says so, checks the recorded output by
   its hash, and rebuilds everything downstream of it.

Phase 2 CI builds one corpus pack with the MSVC, MinGW and emcc builds of
the tool and requires the same bytes (open question 2).

## 6. Reference: where each kind goes at load

| Kind | Player call | Copy at load |
|---|---|---|
| TABLE | `ytb_view(data, size)` | none |
| CALIBRATION | `memcpy` into a `ycol_cal`, then its check | 62528 bytes |
| FONT | `ylay_add_font(data, size, ...)`, `yol` | none |
| CURVESET, ARTWORK | view, `ygfx_cset_check()`, `ygfx_cset_make()` | GPU upload only |
| GLYPHRUNS | view; one `ygfx_crun()` per run, items from the entry | none |
| AUDIO | `yau_wav_load()` from data, or `yau_wav_open()` with a cursor | widened to float (load) or streamed |
| SHADER | view, `ygfx_pipeline()` | none |
| TEXTURE | view, `ygfx_texture()`; QOI decoded first | none raw; one buffer for QOI |
| VIDEO | `yvid_desc.reader` = cursor, `.index` = index entry | streamed |

## 7. Determinism

The same sources, source description and tool version give the same
bytes. What makes it so:

- **Order**: entry 0 is the manifest; the rest are in bytewise name
  order; `ysp/chunks` lists hashes in that order. Work can run on many
  threads; output order does not depend on them.
- **Container**: every field of 2.2 is fixed; zip64 follows 2.3; padding
  follows 2.4; the comment follows 2.6. No timestamps.
- **Manifest text**: keys in bytewise order at every level (changed in
  phase 2 from a documented order: sorting needs no list to keep); two-space
  indentation, one member per line, an array of scalars on one line; LF
  line ends and a final LF; strings escaped only where JSON requires
  (`"`, `\`, and bytes below 0x20 as `\u00xx` in lowercase hex); other
  text as UTF-8 bytes; hex digests in lowercase; integers in decimal; no
  floats (reals are strings, section 3).
- **Paths**: relative to the source description, `/` separators; no
  absolute path enters the pack.
- **Numbers in, bits out**: decimal text is parsed by ysp/table.h's
  correctly rounded parser, never `strtod` (locale) or `printf("%f")`.
- **Pinned code**: the manifest records every library version, the
  Skribidi commit and patch hashes, and the lodepng commit (with
  `,tree-differs` when the fetched file is not the pinned one). It does
  not record the compiler (changed in phase 2): the builds agree, and a
  compiler in the manifest would give one pack a different ID per
  platform. A different tool version may give different bytes; `ypak
  rebuild` says so before it starts.
- **Floating point across compilers**: integer and IEEE basic operations
  (+, -, *, /, sqrt) give the same bits under MSVC, gcc and emcc when the
  build does not contract to FMA (`-ffp-contract=off`, MSVC's default
  `/fp:precise`). ysp/outline.h also calls `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `atan2`,
  `acos`, `cbrt` and `pow` (arcs, strokes, transforms, the SVG number
  parser), whose last bit differs between C runtimes. Fonts without
  strokes use none of them in the output path except `cbrt` inside a
  `ceil`. Measured in phase 2 (9.1): MSVC, MinGW, emcc (musl) and Linux
  gcc (glibc) builds of the tool give the same bytes on a corpus with
  arcs, strokes, skews, CFF cubics, a TrueType collection and glyph runs
  in four scripts. Open question 2 stays open only for platforms not run
  (macOS, ARM).

## 8. Costs: targets and measurements

`examples/pack/bench.c` (`pack_bench`), 2026-10-09, the Iris Xe laptop
(i7-1360P), AC, under the measurement lock (load 6 % at the start),
MinGW gcc 16.1 `-O2` and MSVC 19.44 `/O2`, medians of 9 rounds (5 for the
1 GiB pack), each in a fresh open. Packs built by `ypak` from files: 100
entries of 1 to 4000 bytes (476,598 bytes), 10,000 such entries
(46,744,114 bytes, a 4.8 MB manifest), and one 1 GiB entry.

| What | Target | gcc | MSVC | Met |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ypak_open()`, mapped, 100 entries | at most 0.5 ms | 0.234 ms | 0.254 ms | yes |
| `ypak_open()`, mapped, 10,000 entries | at most 20 ms | 14.7 ms | 15.6 ms | yes; most of it is the manifest's SHA-256 (4.8 MB at the probe's 0.31 to 0.38 GB/s is 13 to 16 ms) |
| `ypak_open()`, mapped, 1 GiB pack | | 0.163 ms | 0.148 ms | |
| Central directory walk and checks | at most 0.2 us an entry | not timed apart | | the 10,000-entry open less its SHA-256 leaves at most about 2 ms |
| `ypak_find()`, shuffled names | median at most 1 us | 0.06 to 0.14 us | 0.06 to 0.14 us | yes |
| Entry hash, memory already touched | at least 10 GB/s | 11.7 to 17.1 GB/s | 11.6 to 16.5 GB/s | yes (MSVC after the load fix, 9.1) |
| `ypak_verify_all()`, mapped first touch, 1 GiB | at least 2 GB/s | 3.45 GB/s | 3.65 GB/s | yes |
| The same, 10,000 small entries | at least 2 GB/s | 1.51 GB/s | 1.20 GB/s | no: about 2 KB an entry, so a page fault and a header check per entry dominate; 16 to 21 ms for the whole pack |
| The same, 100 small entries | | 1.84 GB/s | 1.26 GB/s | 0.14 to 0.20 ms |
| From the SSD, cold | at least 3 GB/s | not run in phase 2 | | the phase 1 probe: 3.22 GB/s read and XXH64 on one thread |
| One 1 MiB chunk through a cursor over a range reader (`fread`, OS cache) | at most 0.5 ms | 0.277 ms | 0.270 ms | yes |
| Browser open, central directory in the 64 KB tail | 2 range requests at most for the directory | 0 for the directory | | the incremental test: the tail, then the manifest's range, then the chunk table's (3 requests in all) |
| Size overhead | at most 4096 + 128 bytes an entry, plus 8 bytes a MiB | 2,182 to 2,190 bytes an entry | | yes |
| Fuzzing | 1 hour of libFuzzer with ASan, no finding | 28,706,212 inputs in 3,601 s, no finding (9.1) | | yes |
| Allocations after open | 0 | 0 | 0 | yes |

Frame budget: after load, a lookup (0.06 to 0.14 us) is the only reader
call a frame needs. Verifying a whole entry happens at load; a chunk
through a cursor costs 0.27 ms on the decode or producer thread.

## 9. Explanation

### 9.1 Measurements

**Checksums**, 2026-10-08, i7-1360P, AC, under the measurement lock (load
6 % and 10 % at the start), 5 rounds, GB/s median (min to max). Native:
MinGW gcc 16.1 `-O2`, xxHash 0.8.3 (`xxhash.h`) for XXH64 and XXH3, a
portable SHA-256, Windows CNG for SHA-256 with the SHA extensions.
WebAssembly: emcc 6.0.10 `-O2`, node 24.19, 256 MiB. Python 3.14.3
(zlib-ng 1.3.1) for the vectorized CRC-32.

| Hash | Native, 1 GiB in memory | WebAssembly | WebAssembly `-msimd128` |
|---|---|---|---|
| reading the bytes (a sum of u64) | 14.2 to 18.5 | | |
| CRC-32, byte table | 0.53 to 0.60 | | |
| CRC-32, slice-by-8 | 2.49 to 3.03 | 1.50 (1.13 to 2.33) | 1.81 (1.81 to 1.89) |
| CRC-32, zlib-ng (carry-less multiply) | 13.82 (12.09 to 14.53) | | |
| XXH64 | 10.2 to 11.7 | 8.77 (3.78 to 9.73) | 11.74 (3.85 to 12.11) |
| XXH3-64, SSE2 | 13.07 to 15.08 | 7.71 (4.39 to 9.85) | 12.72 (5.09 to 13.33) |
| XXH3-64, AVX2 | 15.90 (13.24 to 20.32) | | |
| XXH3-64 over 1 MiB chunks, then the list | 12.9 to 16.2 | | |
| SHA-256, portable C | 0.31 to 0.38 | 0.21 (0.04 to 0.27) | 0.27 (0.06 to 0.27) |
| SHA-256, Windows CNG | 1.96 to 2.31 | | |
| SHA-256, Python hashlib (OpenSSL) | 2.27 (2.09 to 2.36) | | |

Native rows that show a range give the medians of the separate runs.

| From the file, 1 GiB, native | GB/s median (min to max) |
|---|---|
| unbuffered read, 4 MiB blocks | 3.80 to 4.05 |
| unbuffered read, then XXH3 on the same thread | 3.36 to 3.83; 3.62 (3.57 to 3.65) in the XXH64 run |
| unbuffered read, then XXH64 on the same thread | 3.22 (2.93 to 3.34) |
| in the cache, mapped, XXH3 at first touch | 2.41 to 2.57 |
| in the cache, mapped, XXH64 at first touch | 2.20 (1.88 to 2.75) |

What this shows: SHA-256 in portable C is 10 times slower than the SSD,
so it cannot run at load on large entries. XXH64 and XXH3 are both above
the SSD and the page-fault rate; in the same run, XXH3's lead shrinks to
12 % on the cold path (3.62 against 3.22) and 10 % on the mapped path
(2.41 against 2.20). CRC-32 is fast only with carry-less
multiply, which needs per-architecture code and has none in WebAssembly.
ysp/video.h reported 4.3 to 5.3 GB/s for its own XXH64; the reference
implementation gives 10.2 to 11.7 here, so that implementation has room
(not measured here on the same input).

**Zip readers**, 2026-10-08. Packs written by a probe with the layout of
section 2: six entries (14 bytes to 100 KB, one empty, one with a
non-ASCII name), each aligned by 0xD935, the 0x7379 record in the
central directory, zero DOS time, the comment of 2.6. Every reader got
the same names, sizes and SHA-256 values as the input.

| Reader | Plain | zip64 on every entry | 4.4 GB zip64 entry | Appended, relative offsets | Appended, absolute offsets |

The 4.4 GB pack also needed the zip64 end record and locator (its
central directory starts past 4 GiB).

**Phase 2: tests.** 2026-10-08, the same laptop.

| Build | Reader test | Tool test | Other |
|---|---|---|---|
| MSVC 19.44, `/W4 /WX` | 441 checks, 0 failed | 115 checks, 0 failed | full ctest 65 of 65 (with `YSP_BUILD_LAYOUT`, `YSP_BUILD_PACK`) |
| MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1, `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Werror` | 441, 0 failed | 115, 0 failed | full ctest 65 of 65; C99 compile check |
| emcc 6.0.10, node 24.19 | 408, 0 failed (no file source under node) | 115, 0 failed | C11 and C++17 compile checks; ysp/audio.h and ysp/gfx.h tests pass |
| Linux gcc 11.4 (WSL2, glibc) | 441, 0 failed; again under ASan and UBSan as C11 and as C++17, no report | 115, 0 failed | |

The reader test refuses all 135,240 single-bit flips and all 16,905
truncations of a two-entry pack, and refuses each of 29 rule faults for
its own reason (`YPAK_ERR_FORMAT` for a rule, `YPAK_ERR_CORRUPT` for a
hash, `YPAK_ERR_VERSION` for format 2).

**Phase 2: mutations.** `tests/mutate/pack.toml`, 36 mutants (comment and
end records 4, central directory 11, local headers 3, hashes 7, names 3,
cursors, checks and the arena 3, views 5). The first run killed 31; the 5
survivors were gaps in the test, each closed: d-11 (the chunk index
check) needed the fault test to demand the fault's own error code,
because a chunk-list hash refused the same pack a step later; k-02 needed
a fetched range one byte too long; v-01, v-03 and v-04 needed view inputs
that break only the rule under test. Second run: 36 of 36 killed.
`tests/mutate/audio.toml`: 4 of 4. `gfx.toml` v10-07: killed.

**Phase 2: fuzzing.** `tests/fuzz/pack_fuzz.c` under MSVC 19.44
`/fsanitize=address /fsanitize=fuzzer`, from 23 seeds (three packs built
by `ypak`, one of them appended to a program, as targets 0 to 2, and their
pack-own entries as view inputs): 28,706,212 inputs in 3,601 s, no crash,
no timeout, no leak; 1,622 coverage features, 750 corpus files, peak RSS
534 MB. The 750 files replayed on Linux gcc 11.4 under ASan and UBSan, as
C11 and as C++17: no report.

**Phase 2: the same bytes from every build.** See open question 2: the
MSVC, MinGW, emcc and Linux gcc builds of the tool give the same bytes
on a 5.2 MB test corpus and a 208 MB system-font corpus.

**Phase 2: zip readers on packs the tool built.** `tests/pack/compat.py`,
the six readers of the phase 1 table, every entry's SHA-256 against the
manifest: the test corpus (22 entries), a small pack, its copy appended
to a program (absolute offsets), and a 4,300,046,978-byte pack of a
4.3 GB entry followed by a small one (zip64 by size, by local header
offset and by directory offset). Every reader agreed on every pack, Java's
streaming reader excepted on the appended copy (it cannot start inside a
program). `ypak verify` of the 4.3 GB pack: 18 s, every check passed.

**Found while building.** MSVC compiles the reader's byte-by-byte 64-bit
load as eight loads; XXH64 then ran at 5.1 to 6.8 GB/s against gcc's 11.5
to 18. A `memcpy` load under `_MSC_VER` gave 11.6 GB/s (a `_rotl64` rotate
changed nothing). ysp/video.h's XXH64 uses the same byte loads and
reported 4.3 to 5.3 GB/s; its owner may want the same change (not
measured there). One `fwrite` of 4.3 GB under MinGW's msvcrt ran for
minutes and wrote 5 MB; the tool now reads and writes in 16 MiB pieces.

### 9.2 Why zip64 only where needed

Two hours of 1080p H.264 at 8 Mbit/s is 7.2 GB; MPEG-1 for pl_mpeg needs
several times that rate; a frame sequence of raw frames is larger still.
So zip64 is required. Writing it only where a value overflows keeps the
plain form for the common pack, which every reader handles, and the rule
is a function of the sizes, so it is deterministic.

### 9.3 Why padding in the extra field, and why 0xD935

A zip reader that walks local headers from the start (Java's
`ZipInputStream`, bsdtar from a pipe) needs each header right after the
previous entry's data. Padding inside the extra field keeps that true;
padding between entries would not. zipalign used anonymous zero padding
first, which is not a valid extra field; Android's later tools write the
0xD935 record, which APPNOTE lists. Apache Commons Compress has its own
(0xA11E); 0xD935 was chosen because Android's tools made it common.

### 9.4 Why absolute offsets in the appended copy

Measured (9.1): both .NET readers refuse a zip whose offsets are relative
to its own start when bytes precede it, and Info-ZIP warns with exit
code 1. With absolute offsets (Info-ZIP's `zip -A`), every reader that
can read a prefixed zip at all reads it, with no warning. Only the central
directory and the end records change; the entries and the manifest do
not, so the pack ID stays. The reader accepts both forms: it computes the
zip start as (end record position - directory size - directory offset),
as Python's `zipfile` and Java's `ZipFile` do.

### 9.5 Why XXH64, SHA-256 and CRC-32, each for one job

- CRC-32 is in the zip format and lets any zip tool test the pack. Fast
  CRC-32 needs carry-less multiply per architecture and has no
  WebAssembly path (1.5 to 1.8 GB/s there), so the runtime does not use it.
- SHA-256 is the hash that a reviewer can compute with `sha256sum`, that
  `third_party/MANIFEST.sha256` and `ylay_font_info` already use, and
  that resists deliberate collisions, which matters for a citation. At
  0.31 to 0.38 GB/s in portable C it is a build-time and verify-time
  hash. The tool may use the SHA extensions where present (CNG: 1.96 to
  2.31 GB/s); the result is the same by definition.
- XXH64 is the run-time check. It runs at 10 to 12 GB/s natively and in
  WebAssembly, above the SSD (4.0 GB/s) and the page-fault rate of a
  mapped first touch (2.2 to 2.6 GB/s), so verification costs little
  beyond the read that load does anyway. XXH3 is 10 to 12 % faster on
  those paths, but its fast paths are per instruction set (SSE2, AVX2,
  NEON, WebAssembly SIMD) and several hundred lines more to fuzz;
  ysp/video.h already chose XXH64 for its container and index. A future
  format version can change the function; the version field is there for
  that.
- The tree over 1 MiB chunks lets a cursor verify a streamed film chunk
  by chunk (0.1 ms a chunk at 10 GB/s, about 0.3 ms cold), the way a
  browser fetches it, while one entry hash still covers the whole entry.
  Unreal's IoStore and Android's APK Signature Scheme v4 (fs-verity) hash
  chunks for the same reason.

### 9.6 Why a JSON manifest and a binary directory record

The manifest is for people and tools: a reviewer reads it in a text
editor, Python and the browser parse it with no ysp code, and the designer
writes it. The reader header must stay small, dependency-free and safe
on hostile bytes, and it only needs per entry a kind, an offset, a hash
and a chunk index. Those go in the central directory, which the reader
parses anyway and which a browser fetches first. PSTB was considered for
the manifest and not taken: derivations are nested records, not a table,
and PSTB holds at most 32767 rows (16-bit row and level numbers) and sizes only as doubles.

The manifest has no floats because float formatting is where
deterministic JSON writers differ (RFC 8785 needs a whole algorithm for
it). Writing reals as the decimal text that the tool parsed avoids the
problem and records the exact input.

### 9.7 Why the reader checks everything at open but hashes lazily

Structure checks cost microseconds an entry and protect every later
pointer, so they run at open. Hashing a 7 GB film at open would cost
about 2 s cold and is wasted when the session plays one minute of it, so
streamed entries are hashed per chunk as they are read, on the decode
thread. Whole entries are hashed when first used, which is at load, when
their bytes are touched anyway. `YPAK_VERIFY_OPEN` gives a full check
before a session; `YPAK_VERIFY_NONE` exists for a pack checked at
install, and the log says that it was not checked.

### 9.8 Prior art

| Format or tool | What this design takes | What it does not take |
|---|---|---|
| APPNOTE 6.3.10 | zip64 rules, the UTF-8 flag, extra field rules, the 0xD935 entry | encryption, data descriptors, compression methods |
| Android zipalign and apksigner | data alignment by an extra field; 0xD935 | the APK signing block between entries and the directory |
| APK Signature Scheme v4, fs-verity | per-chunk hashes for lazy verification | the Merkle tree depth; signatures |
| Unreal .pak and IoStore | index at the end, per-chunk hashes, compression per block or resource | encryption, its own container |
| Godot .pck | a pack embedded in the executable, found from the end | its own container and MD5 |
| PhysFS | zip as the archive, self-extracting archives found by the end record, path sanitizing | case-insensitive lookup |
| Info-ZIP `zip -A` | absolute offsets in a prefixed archive | |
| miniz, libzip | the central-record-against-local-header consistency check (libzip `ZIP_CHECKCONS`) | the libraries: the reader is ours, bounded and fuzzed |
| Reproducible builds (reproducible-builds.org; `jar --date`) | fixed timestamps, sorted entries, no host data | `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`: a pack has no date at all |
| Web Bundles (WICG) | one file of many resources with an index | the format: CBOR, little browser support, no range-first design |

## 10. Open questions, with the defaults in force

The coordinator adopted each recommendation as the default on
2026-10-08. The user accepted questions 1 and 7 on 2026-10-09; each is
one function in the tool.

1. **Calibration in the pack. Decided 2026-10-09 (user): the rig's.** rig_spec 5.2
   lists Calibration as a pack resource; devices_spec 11.2 (2026-10-08)
   says the display calibration is a file on the rig, beside the rig
   profile. Default: the rig's calibration comes from the rig profile; a
   `.yspcal` in a pack is for preview and simulation only and the player
   never applies it on a rig. The tool records `"role": "preview"`
   (`calibration_role()` in `pack/pack_tool.c`). The user's reason: a
   calibration must be independent of the other resources. rig_spec 5.2's
   row says so.
2. **Byte-equal rebuild across compilers. Measured: no difference.**
   ysp/outline.h calls `sin`, `cos`, `atan2`, `tan`, `acos`, `cbrt` and
   `pow`, whose last bit can differ between C runtimes. The tool built with
   MSVC 19.44 (UCRT), MinGW gcc 16.1 (msvcrt), emcc 6.0.10 (musl, run under
   node) and Linux gcc 11.4 (glibc) gave the same bytes on the test corpus
   (5,249,243 bytes, 22 entries: SVG arcs and strokes, a font, glyph runs
   in Latin and Hebrew, textures, WAV conversions) and on a system-font
   corpus (208,223,010 bytes: Segoe UI, Source Han Sans JP (CFF, cubics),
   Microsoft YaHei (a collection), all glyphs; glyph runs in Latin with
   kerning and ligatures, Arabic, Japanese and Chinese; an SVG with
   elliptical arcs, cubic and quadratic smooth curves, skews, rotations,
   round, miter and bevel joins, and a tolerance of 1e-6). 0 bytes differ.
   No CORE-MATH and no change to ysp/outline.h. Not run: macOS (Apple's
   libm), ARM, and an x87 build. The CI should keep the corpus comparison.
3. **Names beyond ASCII. Default: ASCII.** The writer allows the portable
   ASCII set; the reader accepts UTF-8, so a later tool can widen the set
   (NFC, the tool normalizing names) with no format change.
4. **Audio resampling. Default: refuse.** Built: the refusal names the
   rate and the project rate. Not built: opt-in resampling with
   libsamplerate (BSD-2-Clause) at `SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY` to 32-bit float.
5. **glslang. Default: optional, not linked.** The shader entry records
   `"validated": false` and flag bit 2 stays 0; ANGLE compiles at load and
   names the body's lines.
6. **Texture compression. Default: raw and QOI.** Built. LZ4 and deflate
   are not built. QOI's ratio and decode rate on a real stimulus set are
   not measured yet.
7. **Font licenses. Decided 2026-10-09 (user).** The tool refuses a face whose
   OS/2 `fsType` says restricted license embedding (bits 0 to 3 equal 2)
   unless the description sets `"private": true`, which the manifest
   records (`font_license_ok()` in `pack/pack_tool.c`). A font with no OS/2
   table passes. Editable (8) and installable (0) embedding pass.
8. **PNG decoder. Default: lodepng.** Pinned at
   `e584a8490db1b76b81bf298c11c09d3b55d9c270` with SHA-256 per file and
   fetched by `tools/vendor_pack.py` (not committed; `.gitignore` ignores
   `third_party/*/`). The layout option does not need it.
9. **Source description syntax. Default: JSON.** Strict: unknown keys,
   duplicate keys and numbers with a fraction are refused by name.
10. **Signed Windows players. Not built.** The reader requires the end
    record at the end of the file, so a player signed after the pack was
    appended does not open its pack. Not measured.
11. **Shader contract version. Built** (ysp/gfx.h v0.10.3,
    `YGFX_SHADER_CONTRACT` = 1, recorded in each SHADER entry).

## 11. Phase 2: what was built

| File | Version | What |
|---|---|---|
| `include/ysp/pack.h` | 0.1.0 | The reader (2.12) |
| `include/ysp/audio.h` | 0.2.1 | `yau_wav_probe()` (docs/audio.md, "The WAV probe") |
| `include/ysp/gfx.h` | 0.10.3 | `YGFX_SHADER_CONTRACT` (docs/gfx.md, "v0.10.3") |
| `pack/ysp/pack_tool.h`, `pack/pack_tool.c`, `pack/pack_impl.c` | 0.1.1 | The tool library. 0.1.1 (2026-10-09): the JSON reader and writer moved to `include/ysp/json.h`; every corpus pack is byte-identical to 0.1.0's but for the manifest, which now names ysp/json.h |
| `include/ysp/json.h` | 0.1.0 | The strict JSON reader and canonical writer (docs/json.md) |
| `pack/ypak.c` | 0.1.1 | The CLI |
| `tools/vendor_pack.py` | | Fetches and verifies lodepng |
| `tests/adapt/pack_test.c` | | The reader's test, with its own writer: 29 faults, every bit flip and truncation of a small pack, the four sources, cursors, the arena, a virtual 4.3 GB entry and 65,537 entries (zip64 by size, offset and count), the views |
| `tests/compile/pack.c`, `pack.cpp` | | C11 and C++17 compile checks |
| `tests/fuzz/pack_fuzz.c` | | The libFuzzer target (four targets: memory, incremental, range reader, views) |
| `tests/mutate/pack.toml`, `audio.toml`; `gfx.toml` v10-07 | | Mutations |
| `tests/pack/tool_test.c`, `tests/pack/corpus/` | | The tool end to end: every kind, build twice, verify, rebuild, append, extract, damage, 23 refused descriptions |
| `tests/pack/compat.py` | | The six readers (9.1) |
| `examples/pack/bench.c` | | Section 8 (`pack_bench`) |

CMake: ysp/pack.h is in the library list (group `ysp::core`), so its
compile checks and `test_pack` build with every configuration; the tool,
`ypak` and `test_pack_tool` build with `YSP_BUILD_PACK=ON`.

### Not done

- VIDEO, VIDEO_INDEX, FRAMESEQ and ALPHA in the tool (phase 3); the
  reader reads them.
- Audio resampling, glslang validation, LZ4, JPEG, ELAN and Praat
  imports, spans in glyph runs, BIDS `n/a` cells.
- Signed players (question 10).
- The bench's cold-SSD number: the phase 1 probe measured it (9.1); the
  bench measures the mapped first touch.
- macOS: nothing was run there.
