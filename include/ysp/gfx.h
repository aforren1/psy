/* ysp/gfx.h - v0.10.2 - public domain single-header stimulus graphics library
 *   (with MIT-licensed parts: see below)
 *
 *   Stimuli on GL ES 3.0, on top of ysp/screen.h: signed-distance shapes
 *   with a stated edge profile, gratings, gabors, dot fields, image
 *   textures and hash noise, drawn in linear light into a float scene,
 *   then one output stage (a lookup table per channel from a calibration,
 *   dithering, 8-bit quantization) into the screen's back buffer. Also the
 *   calibration math (cone fundamentals, cone contrast, DKL), a canonical
 *   calibration file, a user shader contract, timeline bindings and a
 *   parameter table. Vector shapes from closed-form distance functions
 *   (v0.3): rounded and partial shapes, paths of up to 224 points,
 *   compounds, effects, dashes, gradients, blend modes, MSDF atlases and
 *   glyph runs. Text and artwork from glyph outlines (v0.6): curve sets of
 *   quadratic curves and bands (Lengyel's Slug algorithm), drawn as curve
 *   runs with box-filter coverage; a separable Gaussian blur pass. No
 *   compute stage, no SVG: the pack tool's outline builder makes the curve
 *   sets (ysp/outline.h).
 *
 *   REQUIRES ysp/screen.h, ysp/rt.h and ysp/color.h beside it, and what
 *   ysp/screen.h needs (SDL3 to link; ANGLE's DLLs at run time on
 *   Windows). Nothing ANGLE or Khronos is needed to compile: GL is loaded
 *   at run time.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. C99 is
 *   the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC
 *   compiles by default.
 *
 *   MIT-LICENSED PARTS: the vector program's distance functions follow
 *   Inigo Quilez's (box, rounded box, uneven capsule, arc, pie, star,
 *   smooth minimum) and 0xfaded's ellipse. They are in ygfx__glsl_vec0,
 *   _vec0b, _vec1 and their CPU forms (ygfx__vp_*, ygfx__vsmin).
 *   Each such function names its source in a comment; the MIT notices are
 *   in the license block at the end of the file. The rest is public domain
 *   / MIT-0.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.10.2 - ygfx_default_cache_dir() is a wrapper of ysp/rt.h v0.7.0's
 *          yrt_user_dir(YRT_DIR_CACHE, "progcache"), which took over its
 *          rules unchanged. Needs ysp/rt.h v0.7.0.
 *   v0.10.1 - PROGRAM CACHE: ygfx_default_cache_dir() gives the per-user
 *          cache folder (it makes no file or folder). The describe line names
 *          the cache folder and gives hits and misses.
 *   v0.10.0 - NOISE: dist YGFX_SIMPLEX, 3D simplex gradient noise as fBm
 *          (noise_desc.scale, z, octaves, lacunarity, gain; stimulus fields
 *          gn_*; parameters YGFX_P_NOISE_SCALE, _Z, _LACUNARITY, _GAIN,
 *          appended), in 32-bit integers on the GPU, so that
 *          ygfx_simplex_value() gives the same bits on the CPU. Not
 *          band-limited (NOISE). Breaking: ygfx_stim grew; the noise
 *          program's cache key changed.
 *   v0.9.0 - NOISE, the noise dither and ygfx_noise_gauss() draw new
 *          patterns. The hash is triple32 (Chris Wellons, hash-prospector,
 *          public domain), not pcg_hash; the key of a point is its index
 *          times an odd key of the seed, XOR a second key, through one hash
 *          (ygfx_hash2(), ysp_hash2()), not three nested hashes. The
 *          nested form, hash(x ^ hash(y ^ hash(seed))), made 29 % of
 *          full-screen frames hold two rows that were copies of each other
 *          (each 2048-value block permuted), whatever the hash; PractRand
 *          failed it at 256 MB. The new form passes 16 GB, frame by frame
 *          and seed by seed (docs/gfx.md, v0.9). The same GPU cost.
 *          Breaking: every noise pattern, the dither pattern, and a user
 *          shader's ysp_hash() values; ygfx_noise_value() and the GPU
 *          still agree bit for bit.
 *   v0.8.0 - SETUP PASSES: ygfx_begin_setup() and ygfx_end_setup()
 *          run target passes outside a screen frame: a page of text, a
 *          blur layer, artwork rendered at setup. CURVE RUNS: a run whose
 *          items are all turned off the quarter turns, or an aliased run,
 *          takes the rays program by itself (the same bits, 0.5 to 0.8 ms
 *          less on a turned page); the rays program is made at
 *          ygfx_crun() for turned, aliased, grouped and YGFX_I_ORI
 *          runs. Breaking: none (a turned run's cache key set gains the
 *          rays program).
 *   v0.7.0 - CURVE RUNS: crun_desc.rays (YGFX_STIM_RAYS, appended) draws
 *          a run by the rays even where the exact area applies, on a second
 *          text program made at the first such run: a 12 px page 5.3 ms
 *          against 7.5. The text program works in px with y down, so a run
 *          drawn once into a target and composited at 1:1 on whole px has
 *          the run's coverage bit for bit. NOISE: dist YGFX_GAUSSIAN, a
 *          table of 65536 normal quantiles (256 KB, made at open), the same
 *          bits on the GPU and from ygfx_noise_value(). VECTOR: three
 *          specialized copies of the vector program for large RRECTs,
 *          dashed CIRCLEs and CIRCLE compounds (14 programs at open; the
 *          kinds worker's design, docs/gfx.md). ELLIPSE's quarter
 *          perimeter by the arithmetic-geometric mean: a pack 0.06 us, was
 *          36 us (1000 ELLIPSEs 0.06 ms of CPU, was 36 ms); the same floats.
 *          Fixed: none. Breaking: ygfx_crun_desc grew (rays); the text and
 *          noise programs' cache keys changed.
 *   v0.6.0 - CURVE SETS: ygfx_cset_make(), ygfx_cset_add(),
 *          ygfx_cset_free(), and with no gfx ygfx_cset_check() and
 *          ygfx_cset_winding(): one font or artwork set as two arrays
 *          (texels, words), the format of docs/gfx.md "Curve sets: the
 *          format" (version 1), uploaded as one RGBA32F and one RGBA32UI
 *          texture. CURVE RUNS: ygfx_crun() and ygfx_crun_desc, items
 *          ygfx_citem (ygfx_inst's layout with glyph in phase's place),
 *          kind YGFX_TEXT (until now not implemented), YGFX_P_SIZE,
 *          YGFX_STIM_ALIASED; ygfx_hit() and ygfx_hit_index() on a
 *          run. BLUR: ygfx_blur, ygfx_blur_desc, ygfx_blur_make(),
 *          ygfx_blur_apply(), ygfx_blur_free(); targets in R16F and
 *          RGBA32F; image_desc.coverage (YGFX_STIM_COVERAGE). The video
 *          program reads its constants as flat inputs: NV12 at 1080p costs
 *          1.10 to 1.16 times an RGBA8 image (was 1.64). Backend: the
 *          format YGFX_RGBA32UI, caps.max_texture (appended; 0 = 2048),
 *          a sampler in the vertex shader; version 3 still. Breaking:
 *          ygfx_stim grew (set, items, size); every program's cache key
 *          changed (the vertex text), so a cache compiles once again.
 *   v0.5.0 - COLOR: the calibration is ysp/color.h's. ygfx_cal and its
 *          calls are ycol_cal and ycol_cal_* (init, add, set_spectra,
 *          derive, check, save, load, nominal, lms, dir_cone, dkl_matrix,
 *          dir_dkl), YGFX_CAL_* and YGFX_GUN_* are YCOL_CAL_* and
 *          YCOL_GUN_*, ygfx_dkl_from_sph and ygfx_max_contrast are
 *          ycol_dkl_from_sph and ycol_max_contrast, and
 *          ygfx_cone_fundamentals(nm, lms) is
 *          ycol_cone_fundamentals(YCOL_CONES_SS2, nm, lms): the same
 *          code, the same bits, the same .yspcal bytes. desc.cal is a
 *          const ycol_cal*. ysp/color.h must be beside ysp/gfx.h.
 *          open() makes a ysp/color.h context (ycol_ctx) from desc.cal,
 *          desc.background and the new desc.cones and desc.lum, and takes
 *          PAINT's matrices and VIDEO's primaries from it;
 *          ygfx_color(g) returns it, so a caller converts colors and
 *          DKL directions with the background and luminance PAINT uses. A
 *          YGFX_EV_COLOR ring record at open logs it. desc.lum (a
 *          participant's luminance from flicker photometry) sets the DKL
 *          luminance axis for DKL_POLAR paint; desc.cones picks the 2 or
 *          10 degree cones. OKLAB paint now works on absolute XYZ, the
 *          display's black included, against the display's white:
 *          ysp/color.h's Oklab. A calibration whose black has no light
 *          gives the same pixels as v0.4 (every calibration in v0.4's
 *          test); one with 0.5 cd/m2 of black under a white of 80 moves
 *          the test's OKLAB gradient by up to 5.2e-3 of full scale. A calibration that
 *          is not sealed (no CRC after the last change) is refused at
 *          open: ycol_cal_derive() and ycol_cal_save() seal it.
 *   v0.4.0 - PROGRAM CACHE: desc.cache (a load and store pair the caller
 *          owns), ygfx_file_cache_init(), ygfx_program_stats(); an
 *          entry is checked by a second hash of its key and a hash of its
 *          binary before the driver sees it. VIDEO: YGFX_NV12 and
 *          YGFX_I420 textures with a stated encoding (matrix, range,
 *          transfer, primaries, siting) converted to linear light in the
 *          image program; encoded RGB textures; texture_update_planes(),
 *          texture_update_plane(), texture_import() (GL names; D3D11 RGBA
 *          and NV12 through ANGLE), texture_rebind(). INSTANCES:
 *          ygfx_instances(), ygfx_inst_grid(), ygfx_hit_index(),
 *          ygfx_inst_resolve(), desc.max_instances. ygfx_screen(),
 *          ygfx_calibrated(), ygfx_features(). Fixed (found by the
 *          gallery): ygfx_cal_derive() seals the CRC (the manual's recipe
 *          failed open with "CRC mismatch" until a save; cal_add() and
 *          cal_set_spectra() unseal it); a straight-alpha image drawn with
 *          linear filtering is filtered as premultiplied texels (clear
 *          texels darkened its edges; image_desc.premultiplied states a
 *          premultiplied texture); the range rule holds on DIST atlases
 *          with texture_desc.sdf_range (glyph runs and src rectangles on
 *          one without it are refused); a glyph run with no buffer read
 *          past the pool. Added: first (a run or dot field from any record
 *          of a shared buffer) on glyph and dot descs; shape_p on the
 *          grating, noise and user descs. Breaking: backend version 3
 *          (BACKENDS says what an out-of-tree backend changes);
 *          ygfx_texture_update() on a planar texture is refused; a
 *          straight-alpha image drawn linear looks different at its
 *          transparent edges (correct now). Also: end() reorders draws
 *          that do not overlap, so runs form across interleaved kinds
 *          (DRAW ORDER; identical pixels); a stimulus that can cover no
 *          pixel is refused with a message (v0.3 drew nothing); a dot
 *          field with no aperture set draws (v0.1 to v0.3 culled every
 *          dot); a POLYGON with no box takes its vertices' own; an empty
 *          dot field or glyph run returns OK; every refusal in draw()
 *          names its reason.
 *   v0.3.0 - the vector program (VECTOR SHAPES): SHAPE kinds RRECT, ARC,
 *          PIE, CAPSULE, NGON, STAR, ELLIPSE, QBEZIER, POLYLINE and
 *          COMPOUND (ygfx_compound(), up to 56 primitives folded by
 *          UNION, INTERSECT, SUBTRACT, XOR and smooth variants, onion);
 *          POLYGON fillets; offset (dilation) on every SHAPE; dashes,
 *          dash_offset, dash_snap, trim and caps; effects in one pass
 *          (drop shadow, glow, inner shadow, two bands, an exact blur for a
 *          sharp RECT's shadow); paint (LINEAR, RADIAL, ANGULAR, VERTEX;
 *          mixed in RGB, OKLAB or DKL_POLAR); blend modes OVER, ADD and
 *          MULTIPLY on color stimuli; ygfx_length(); the parameter tables
 *          ygfx_prim_params(), ygfx_fx_params(), ygfx_paint_params()
 *          and ygfx_bind.field. DISTANCE TEXTURES: MSDF and MTSDF masks
 *          with sdf_range and the range rule; a mask's src rectangle;
 *          ygfx_glyphs(), an instanced glyph run. The edge model's limits
 *          are stated and measured (EDGES, EXACTNESS). Backend version 2:
 *          deferred pipelines and pipeline_finish (ANGLE compiles the
 *          programs in parallel), bindings.blend, YGFX_BLEND_MULTIPLY,
 *          two vec4 instance attributes. Breaking: a backend must set
 *          version 2 and may leave pipeline_finish NULL; max_draws counts
 *          uniform blocks (a vector stimulus with data takes more than
 *          one); a USER stimulus with a MASK_TEX aperture loses p[28..31]
 *          to the mask's rectangle.
 *   v0.2.0 - strokes on every SDF shape and aperture (CENTER, INSIDE or
 *          OUTSIDE, the same edge profile on both sides of the band; ROUND
 *          or MITER joins, MITER on RECT, CROSS and convex POLYGON with a
 *          miter limit and a bevel beyond it); YGFX_MASK_TEX, a shape from
 *          a signed-distance texture, and ygfx_sdf_from_mask(); sprites:
 *          an IMAGE's source rectangle, nearest or linear, with no bleed;
 *          tint; flat groups (ygfx_group: place, anchor, box, x, y, ori,
 *          scale, opacity) with bindings; render targets
 *          (ygfx_target(), ygfx_begin_target(), ygfx_end_target(),
 *          ygfx_read_target()) and YGFX_STIM_ADD images; the YGFX_ADD
 *          shader mode; the GL state cache follows yscr_gl_epoch().
 *          Breaking: ysp_look.w in the shader contract is the stroke band's
 *          center offset, not visible; ygfx_stim and ygfx_bind grew
 *          (zero a ygfx_bind you fill field by field; an initializer list
 *          gets a NULL group for gcc -Wextra); the OVER blend now
 *          accumulates alpha (the scene's output is unchanged); IMAGE's
 *          linear sampling is by hand from four texelFetch, clamped to the
 *          source rectangle, not the sampler's.
 *   v0.1.0 - first release.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.10.0 (docs/gfx.md "v0.10"): SIMPLEX on the GPU equals
 *   ygfx_simplex_value() at every pixel of 6 fields (227000 pixels; 1 to
 *   8 octaves, lacunarity 1 to 3, z negative and fractional) on the Iris
 *   Xe, WARP and SwiftShader. The integer form is within 1.4e-3 of the same
 *   noise in double. Full screen on the Iris Xe: 1.83 ms for one octave,
 *   6.56 ms for four, 12.96 ms for eight (UNIFORM 0.40).
 *   v0.9.0 (docs/gfx.md "v0.9" has the hash's evaluation):
 *   NOISE on the GPU equals ygfx_noise_value() at every check, for
 *   UNIFORM, BINARY and GAUSSIAN, on the Iris Xe, WARP and SwiftShader.
 *   v0.8.0 (docs/gfx.md "v0.8"). A page rendered in a setup
 *   pass equals the page rendered in a frame, target and composite, bit for
 *   bit; a blur applied in a setup pass equals one applied in a frame; the
 *   frame after a setup pass equals one with none before it, scene and
 *   output codes (Iris Xe, WARP, SwiftShader). Turned, aliased and
 *   item-turned runs on the rays program equal the exact-area program's
 *   pixels, bit for bit, on all three; a run with one item on a quarter
 *   turn, or with its items in a buffer, stays on the exact-area program.
 *   A 12 px page turned 15 degrees: 5.09 to 5.10 ms, was 5.83 to 6.03; a
 *   16 px CJK page turned: 5.92 to 5.94 ms, was 6.39 to 6.61.
 *   v0.7.0 (docs/gfx.md "v0.7" has the tables). A run with
 *   .rays draws what the program without the exact area draws, bit for bit;
 *   a run cached in an RGBA16F or RGBA32F target and composited at 1:1
 *   equals the run drawn, bit for bit, over black (Iris Xe, WARP,
 *   SwiftShader); over a gray background an RGBA16F target differs by one
 *   f16 step (its alpha was rounded before the blend), an RGBA32F one not
 *   at all. ysp/outline.h's set of the test glyphs, overlaps resolved:
 *   every glyph within 1.15e-5 of the exact coverage. NOISE GAUSSIAN: the
 *   table within 6e-8 (relative) of quantiles found by bisection on erfc,
 *   variance 1, symmetric bit for bit; 10^6 checks pass Kolmogorov-Smirnov
 *   at 1 % (D 0.00095); the GPU equals ygfx_noise_value() at every check
 *   on all three renderers. The specialized vector programs: 117 stimuli
 *   drawn by each and by the generic program, 0 values differ. Cost (Iris
 *   Xe, AC, the shared guard): a 12 px page (ysp/outline.h's set) 7.43 to
 *   7.50 ms exact, 5.28 to 5.31 ms with .rays, 0.50 ms composited from a
 *   target; GAUSSIAN noise full screen 0.41 to 0.42 ms against UNIFORM's
 *   0.37 to 0.39; RRECT fill 0.56 to 0.59 ms (was 0.95), a dashed circle
 *   0.50 to 0.53 (was 0.92 to 0.95), a compound of 8 with every effect 0.94
 *   to 0.98 (was 1.60 to 1.62); ygfx_open() 2.20 to 2.49 s, was 2.04 to
 *   2.12 (three more programs).
 *   v0.6.0 (docs/gfx.md "v0.6" has the tables). Curve runs
 *   against the exact box coverage of each pixel in double (scanlines,
 *   Gauss-Kronrod in y, the fill rule per scanline): on resolved glyphs
 *   not turned, the exact area is within 1.8e-5 of it; elsewhere the rays'
 *   mean error on edge pixels is 0.029, 0.019, 0.009 and 0.004 at 8, 12, 24
 *   and 48 px per em, the same at 0, 15 and 45 degrees (Lengyel's ramp
 *   alone: 0.031 to 0.074 at 8 px, the turned ones worst), and the largest
 *   error 0.56, at corners and self-intersections. Iris Xe, WARP and
 *   SwiftShader agree pixel by pixel within 6.5e-5 but for one SwiftShader
 *   pixel (0.087, where a ray passes a corner). The probe's 0.49
 *   difference between renderers came from interpolated em coordinates:
 *   with them, SwiftShader moved 26156 pixels by more than 1e-3 (up to
 *   0.48) from the Iris Xe; from gl_FragCoord, none. A curve run equals
 *   its items drawn alone and a buffer copied items, bit for bit; a glyph
 *   added at run time draws as one made at open; ygfx_hit() agrees with
 *   aliased coverage at all 64000 pixels. The blur against the exact blur
 *   of a rect (erf products): 0.20, 0.031, 0.0087, 0.0022, 5.4e-4 and
 *   1.5e-4 at sigma 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 (RGBA32F); a 2x source 0.038,
 *   0.0076, 0.0021, 5.4e-4, 1.4e-4 and 3.8e-5; 16-bit targets level off at
 *   about 8e-4. 29 deliberate faults in v0.6, each caught (docs/gfx.md);
 *   two first survived and led to a fix (a curve that turns back before a
 *   ray counted as crossing it).
 *   Cost on the Iris Xe at 1920 x 1200 (AC, the lock held, interleaved; GPU
 *   over an empty frame; backward lists): a 12 px Latin page of 26205
 *   glyphs 7.9 to 8.2 ms with the exact area, 5.5 to 5.8 ms by the rays
 *   alone; a 16 px CJK page of 7140 glyphs 10.0 to 10.2 and 7.2 to 7.7 ms;
 *   1612 glyphs at 48 px 1.7 ms; 45 glyphs at 200 px 1.1 ms (rays 1.6); a
 *   40-glyph line with its items copied each frame 0.09 ms of GPU and 17 us
 *   of CPU. The text program compiles in 430 ms (140 ms without the exact
 *   area) on ANGLE's D3D11; the program cache loads it after. The blur, full
 *   screen R16F: 1.42, 1.96, 3.34 and 5.96 ms at sigma 0.5, 1, 2 and 4;
 *   RGBA32F at sigma 2 3.57 ms; a 400 x 200 layer drawn, blurred and drawn
 *   0.10 to 0.27 ms at sigma 0.5 to 4 (1x), 0.17 to 0.66 ms (2x). Video
 *   1080p: NV12 0.64 to 0.68 ms, RGBA8 0.56 to 0.59 ms (v0.5: NV12 0.96).
 *   ygfx_open() and every v0.3 and v0.4 row: unchanged (interleaved
 *   against v0.5.0).
 *   v0.5.0: the calibration moved to ysp/color.h with the same
 *   bits: every scene and output readback of the test, hashed, is the same
 *   as v0.4's on the Iris Xe, WARP and SwiftShader, and v0.4's calibration
 *   code and ysp/color.h's agreed bit for bit before the move (52
 *   calibrations, 2100 raw calls, PAINT's matrices and the video
 *   primaries; docs/color.md). The new OKLAB black term: within 7.3e-7
 *   of an independent double reference on all three, on a calibration
 *   whose black has 0.5 cd/m2 under a white of 80, where v0.4's black-free
 *   form would have moved the gradient by 5.2e-3. What follows is v0.4's
 *   status, which v0.5 does not change.
 *   v0.4.0: built and run on one Windows 11 laptop (Intel Iris Xe,

 *   GPU and 0.30 to 0.39 ms to update, RGBA8 0.56 ms and 0.91 to 1.03 ms.
 *   Instances: each element within 9.2e-6 of the same stimulus drawn
 *   alone, the palette's integer entries exact, ygfx_hit_index() equal
 *   to the GPU's coverage; 10000 gabors 177 to 191 us of CPU and 1.26 to
 *   1.33 ms of GPU (5.5 ms one stimulus each). The draw order: 20 frames
 *   reordered equal call order bit for bit; 1000 interleaved stimuli of 4
 *   kinds 1.1 ms of GPU and 0.47 ms of CPU (7.2 and 3.3 in call order).
 *   35 deliberate faults in v0.4, each caught. Fixed: v0.1's dot fields
 *   with no aperture set drew nothing (aperture 0 was a 0 x 0 RECT): the
 *   dot rows measured before v0.4 are void.
 *   Outside this block and docs/gfx.md, a number in this header is a
 *   measurement only where the text says "measured".

 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_GFX_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header. ysp/screen.h's and
 *   ysp/rt.h's implementations come with it, once.
 *
 *   A gabor in the middle of a mid-gray window (examples/gfx/hello.c):
 *
 *       #define YSP_GFX_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       #include "ysp/gfx.h"
 *
 *       static yscr_screen scr;
 *       static ygfx_gfx gfx;
 *
 *       int main(void) {
 *           if (!yscr_open(&scr, &(yscr_desc){ .windowed = true })) return 1;
 *           if (!ygfx_open(&gfx, &(ygfx_desc){ .screen = &scr,
 *                                   .background = { 0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f } })) return 1;
 *           ygfx_stim g = ygfx_gabor(&(ygfx_gabor_desc){
 *               .sf = 1 / 32.0f, .sigma = 32, .contrast = 0.5f });
 *           yscr_frame f;
 *           while (yscr_begin(&scr, &f) == YSCR_OK) {   // Shift+Esc ends it
 *               ygfx_begin(&gfx, &f);
 *               ygfx_draw(&gfx, &g);
 *               ygfx_end(&gfx);
 *               yscr_flip(&scr);
 *           }
 *           ygfx_close(&gfx);
 *           yscr_close(&scr);
 *       }
 *
 *   PsychoPy and Psychtoolbox, for comparison:
 *
 *       win = visual.Window(units='pix', color=0)          # PsychoPy
 *       g = visual.GratingStim(win, tex='sin', mask='gauss', sf=1/32,
 *                              size=256, contrast=0.5)
 *       while not event.getKeys(['escape']):
 *           g.draw(); win.flip()
 *
 *       PsychImaging('PrepareConfiguration');               % Psychtoolbox
 *       PsychImaging('AddTask', 'General', 'FloatingPoint32BitIfPossible');
 *       win = PsychImaging('OpenWindow', 0, 0.5);
 *       tex = CreateProceduralGabor(win, 256, 256, 0, [0.5 0.5 0.5 0]);
 *       while ~KbCheck
 *           Screen('DrawTexture', win, tex, [], [], 0, [], [], [], [], ...
 *                  kPsychDontDoRotation, [180, 1/32, 32, 50, 1, 0, 0, 0]);
 *           Screen('Flip', win);
 *       end
 *
 *   The differences: PsychoPy's 'gauss' mask has SD = size / 6 (42.7 px
 *   here); here sigma is stated. PTB scales its procedural gabor's contrast
 *   by its normalization options. Coordinates: here the origin is the
 *   top-left corner, y down, and ori turns clockwise on the screen;
 *   PsychoPy's origin is the center with y up, and its ori is clockwise
 *   from vertical; PTB's origin is top-left, y down, angles clockwise. Both
 *   draw for "the next flip"; here a frame is drawn for f.onset, the
 *   predicted onset of its own flip.
 *
 *   A trial with timeline bindings (examples/timeline/gfx_trial.c runs it):
 *
 *       static ygfx_stim grating;
 *       static const ygfx_bind binds[] = {
 *           { .stim = &grating, .param = YGFX_P_VISIBLE,  .channel = GRATING_ON }, // onset, offset
 *           { .stim = &grating, .param = YGFX_P_CONTRAST, .channel = CONTRAST   }, // a tween or keys
 *       };
 *       ...
 *       yscr_begin(&scr, &f);
 *       ytl_evaluate(&tl, &(ytl_frame){ f.onset, f.period, f.index }, fired, 8);
 *       ygfx_apply(binds, 2, ytl_values(&tl));
 *       yscr_mark(&scr, YSCR_PHASE_EVALUATE);
 *       ygfx_texture_update(&gfx, noise, 0, 0, w, h, next_noise, 0);  // if any
 *       yscr_mark(&scr, YSCR_PHASE_UPLOAD);
 *       ygfx_begin(&gfx, &f);
 *       ygfx_draw(&gfx, &grating);
 *       ygfx_end(&gfx);
 *       yscr_flip(&scr);                    // unmarked time goes to DRAW
 *
 *   A drifting carrier takes its phase from the predicted onset, computed
 *   in double on the CPU, so no shader needs absolute time:
 *
 *       g.phase = (float)fmod(tf_hz * (f.onset - t0) * 1e-9, 1.0);
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TWO STAGES
 *     Stimuli draw into a float scene target (RGBA16F: 11 bits of mantissa,
 *     a quarter of an 8-bit code at worst; an RGBA32F scene measured 1.4 to
 *     1.7 times the GPU time on blend-heavy frames) in linear device RGB:
 *     per gun, 0..1, proportional to that gun's light after linearization.
 *     The output stage then reads the scene once per pixel, looks each
 *     channel up in the CLUT, dithers if asked, quantizes to 8 bits and
 *     writes framebuffer 0, the screen's back buffer. Gamma lives
 *     only there: SDL3 has no gamma ramps.
 *   TWO BLENDS
 *     A modulation stimulus (GRATING, GABOR, NOISE, an IMAGE with
 *     modulation, a MODULATION user shader) adds
 *         contrast * gate * g(p) * aperture(p) * dir
 *     to the scene, g in [-1, 1]. Overlapping gabors add in linear light.
 *     dir all 0 means the background, so contrast is Michelson luminance
 *     contrast around it: L = Lbg (1 + contrast g). The calibration gives
 *     dir for a cone-contrast or DKL direction. A color stimulus (SHAPE,
 *     DOTS, a color IMAGE, a COLOR user shader) is blended over the scene
 *     with coverage * opacity * gate.
 *   DRAW ORDER
 *     Call order wherever stimuli overlap; draws that do not overlap may be
 *     reordered, with identical pixels. No depth buffer. visible < 0.5
 *     skips a draw. (v0.4) end() lets a draw join an earlier run of its kind
 *     when its bounds meet none of the draws it moves past: then no pixel
 *     gets both, and blending reads only its own pixel, so no value can
 *     change, whatever the blend. The bounds are the draw's quad (half size
 *     plus the margin of its edge, stroke, offset and effects, turned) plus
 *     1 px; instanced draws, dot fields and glyph runs have the whole pass
 *     as bounds, so nothing passes them. Target passes keep their order.
 *     Tested bit for bit against call order (docs/gfx.md).
 *   NOTHING READS A CLOCK
 *     What a frame shows is a function of the yscr_frame given to begin():
 *     f.onset, f.index, f.vblank. No call in the frame waits for the GPU
 *     (no glFinish, no glGet, no readback), so drawing cannot move a flip;
 *     a GPU that cannot keep up shows as SWAP time and drops in the flip
 *     record. The reads (ygfx_read_scene, _output) block, for tests.
 *   COST
 *     draw() packs the stimulus into a 256-byte uniform block and queues
 *     it. end() uploads the frame's blocks in one call, then draws each run
 *     of queued stimuli that share a program and textures as one instanced
 *     draw, up to 16 per draw, in order (measured: 1000 gabors cost 0.2 to
 *     0.5 ms of CPU this way, 2.1 to 5.0 ms one draw each; a longer batch
 *     makes ANGLE's compile slower: 64 took 2.2 s to open, 256 took 19 s).
 *     A vector stimulus whose data fills more than its block (VECTOR
 *     SHAPES) takes the blocks after it and draws alone. Runs form across
 *     interleaved kinds where they do not overlap (DRAW ORDER); a large
 *     array of one stimulus is cheaper as INSTANCES.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   COORDINATES
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Screen pixels: the origin is the top-left corner of the screen (or of
 *   the headless target), x right, y down, pixel centers at + 0.5. Units
 *   are pixels, or degrees (desc.units = YGFX_DEG): one scale factor,
 *   the pixels per degree at the screen center from desc.view, with the
 *   same origin and axes.
 *   ori is in degrees and turns +x toward +y: clockwise on the screen. ori
 *   0 puts a carrier along x (vertical bars).
 *   Two fields place a stimulus:
 *     place     the screen point x, y are measured from: one of nine
 *               (YGFX_CENTER, the default, YGFX_TOP_LEFT, ... ,
 *               YGFX_BOTTOM_RIGHT). x, y are along the screen axes, so +y
 *               is down from it. .x = 100 is 100 px right of the center;
 *               .place = YGFX_TOP_LEFT, .x = 10, .y = 10 is 10 px in from
 *               that corner. Not bindable.
 *     anchor    the point of the stimulus's own box that sits at x, y, and
 *               the point it turns about: ax, ay as fractions of the box,
 *               0, 0 its top-left corner and 1, 1 its bottom-right (y
 *               down). The same idea as Phaser's setOrigin and Pixi's
 *               sprite.anchor; the default here is the center, 0.5, 0.5, as
 *               in Phaser (Pixi's default is the top-left). A desc takes it
 *               as one of the nine names; the stimulus holds ax, ay as
 *               bindable floats.
 *   The box is w x h for shapes, gratings, noise, images and user shaders,
 *   the 8-sigma quad for a gabor unless w, h are set, and the field's
 *   aperture box for DOTS (the anchor moves the field, not each dot).
 *   Shapes, apertures and carriers are defined about the box's own
 *   center, so moving the anchor moves and turns a stimulus but does not
 *   change its pattern.
 *   ygfx_resolve() gives the anchor's screen position, ygfx_bounds()
 *   the turned box's axis-aligned bounds, ygfx_hit() whether a screen
 *   pixel is inside (where the GPU's coverage is 0.5 or more, by the same
 *   SDF on the CPU), ygfx_center() and ygfx_size() the screen's.
 *   SDL's mouse events are in window coordinates. At a pixel density of 1
 *   they are these pixels; at another density, multiply them by
 *   SDL_GetWindowPixelDensity() first (STATUS gives what this machine
 *   reported).
 *   The convention lives in one function of the implementation,
 *   ygfx__place() and its helpers; the shaders take what it computes.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   GROUPS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A ygfx_group is a plain value, like a stimulus: place, anchor (ax, ay
 *   of its box), box w x h (units; 0 x 0 is a point), x, y, ori, scale,
 *   opacity and visible. A stimulus joins one with .group = &group (NULL is
 *   none). For a member:
 *     its place is a point of the group's box, not of the screen, and its
 *       x, y and ori are in the group's frame;
 *     the group's frame is its anchor at its own place point plus (x, y),
 *       turned by its ori and scaled by its scale;
 *     scale applies to everything in units (positions, sizes, sigma, shape
 *       parameters, dot positions; sf is divided by it), never to what is
 *       in px (edge_width, stroke, dot_size, check): a px value sets the
 *       stimulus's spatial-frequency content at the panel. Pixi's
 *       container.scale zooms everything; this one does not;
 *     opacity multiplies each member's gate (a color member's alpha and a
 *       modulation member's contrast). It is not a flattened layer: two
 *       overlapping members at 0.5 do not look like one layer at 0.5. A
 *       flattened layer is a target (TARGETS) drawn with opacity.
 *   One level: a group has no group. A tree would need a walk per draw and a
 *   rule for cycles, and a bound channel on a group would then move the
 *   screen by an amount that depends on its ancestors. Deeper composition
 *   goes through a target. A ygfx_bind with .group set binds a group
 *   field (YGFX_G_*), so one channel moves every member on the next draw.
 *   ygfx_resolve(), _bounds(), _local() and _hit() go through the group.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TARGETS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ygfx_target() makes a render target at setup (RGBA16F, RGBA8, R16F,
 *   or RGBA32F where the renderer has EXT_float_blend),
 *   cleared to transparent black. Between ygfx_begin() and ygfx_end()
 *   (or in a setup pass, below),
 *   ygfx_begin_target(t, clear) and ygfx_end_target() draw into it with
 *   the normal calls (clear NULL keeps what it holds, so "draw once, sample
 *   every frame" works); then ygfx_image() draws it like any texture. The
 *   rules:
 *     coordinates in a target are its own: origin its top-left corner, y
 *       down, place points of its box, the same px per unit;
 *     its rows are top first, as an uploaded image's, so it is sampled and
 *       read (ygfx_read_target) with no flip;
 *     it holds scene-space linear values: no CLUT, dither or quantization
 *       runs in it; the CLUT applies once, in the output stage. RGBA8 keeps
 *       linear values in 1/255 steps, coarse in the dark: use it for masks
 *       and flat colors; RGBA16F holds negative increments too;
 *     color is premultiplied: draws accumulate alpha, and ygfx_image() on
 *       a target sets YGFX_STIM_PREMULTIPLIED;
 *     a target filled with modulation stimuli is a layer of increments:
 *       draw it with .add (YGFX_STIM_ADD), which adds texel.rgb scaled by
 *       contrast, gate, tint and aperture;
 *     a draw that samples the target being drawn is refused
 *       (YGFX_ERR_ORDER): GL calls that a feedback loop. A target sampled
 *       before the pass that writes it in the same frame shows the previous
 *       frame: call order decides;
 *     at most YGFX_MAX_PASSES (16) target passes per frame, not nested;
 *       nothing is allocated for them in the frame loop.
 *   SETUP PASSES (v0.8): ygfx_begin_setup() .. ygfx_end_setup() fills
 *   targets outside a screen frame, at setup or between trials:
 *       ygfx_begin_setup(&gfx);
 *       ygfx_begin_target(&gfx, page, (const float[4]){ 0, 0, 0, 0 });
 *       ygfx_draw(&gfx, &text);
 *       ygfx_end_target(&gfx);
 *       ygfx_end_setup(&gfx);
 *   Inside one: target passes (16, not nested, as in a frame), draws into
 *   them and ygfx_blur_apply(). Refused (YGFX_ERR_ORDER): a draw into
 *   the scene, ygfx_end(), ygfx_begin(), a second begin_setup, and
 *   begin_setup inside a frame. end_setup() runs the passes and touches
 *   neither the scene, the output stage, the present nor the frame count;
 *   the next frame is the same, bit for bit, as one with no setup pass
 *   before it (tested). The passes see a frame of time 0 and index 0. It
 *   makes the GL context current and allocates nothing.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   STIMULI
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   One plain struct, ygfx_stim, for every kind; set fields directly.
 *   Constructors take a desc whose zero fields mean defaults, and return a
 *   stimulus with real values in every field (visible, gate, contrast,
 *   opacity, aspect 1; anchor 0.5, 0.5). After construction a 0 is a 0.
 *   SHAPE    an SDF shape in a solid color: RECT (corner radius shape_p[1]),
 *            CIRCLE (diameter w), ANNULUS (inner radius shape_p[0]), LINE
 *            (length w, width shape_p[0], round caps), POLYGON (shape_p[0]
 *            vertices, 3 to 16, x, y pairs in p[] from the box center), CROSS
 *            (arm width shape_p[0]). The v0.3 kinds, compounds, offsets,
 *            dashes, effects, paint and blend modes: VECTOR SHAPES.
 *   GRATING  sine, or square (wave 1), cos(2 pi (sf x + phase)) along the
 *            box's x from its center, in the shape as an aperture.
 *   GABOR    cos(2 pi (sf x + phase)) exp(-(x^2 + (aspect y)^2) / 2 sigma^2);
 *            the quad is 8 sigma unless w, h are set: the envelope is
 *            3.4e-4 at the cut, 0.04 of an 8-bit code at contrast 1.
 *   DOTS     count dots, each an SDF circle of dot_size px with the edge
 *            profile, at x, y float pairs (units, from the field's center)
 *            in a ygfx_buffer; drawn when the dot's center is in the
 *            field's aperture (RECT, CIRCLE or none). One instanced draw.
 *            The aperture is none unless set with a w (aperture 0 is
 *            YGFX_RECT; before v0.4 that zero default culled every dot).
 *            first picks the first x, y pair of buf; count 0 draws nothing.
 *   No area  a stimulus whose box, width or ring can cover no pixel is
 *            refused by draw() with a message naming the field (v0.4): it
 *            is never drawn as nothing. A POLYGON with no w, h takes its
 *            vertices' extent.
 *   IMAGE    a texture, or its source rectangle src (texels from the
 *            top-left; a sprite from an atlas), 1:1 by texelFetch unless
 *            linear; color, the red channel as g (modulation), or rgb as an
 *            increment (add). Nearest reads one texel by its integer
 *            address, clamped to the rectangle; linear interpolates by hand
 *            from four texelFetch whose addresses are clamped to the
 *            rectangle: neither can read a neighbor, so an atlas needs no
 *            padding (the outer half texel repeats the edge texel, as
 *            clamping to the edge does). No mipmaps: draw sprites at 1:1 or
 *            larger. tint multiplies linear light: color rgb by tint.rgb,
 *            coverage by tint.a; for a modulation, dir by tint.rgb and the
 *            amplitude by tint.a (the same as dir and contrast); for add,
 *            the increment by tint.rgb and tint.a. 16-bit planes are R16UI,
 *            read as k / 65535. Values are linear: an 8-bit sRGB photograph
 *            is the pack tool's to linearize.
 *   NOISE    per check of `check` px from the box's top-left corner (its
 *            key ygfx_hash2(cx, cy, seed): independent checks, no row or
 *            frame a copy of another; v0.9):
 *            uniform in (-1, 1), binary +-1, or (v0.7) GAUSSIAN, N(0, 1)
 *            as one of 65536 equally likely values (the normal quantiles
 *            at the bins' centers, scaled to variance 1, largest 4.33),
 *            from an integer hash of the check and seed, bit for bit what
 *            ygfx_noise_value() gives. contrast is the SD for GAUSSIAN;
 *            values past 1 / contrast leave the gamut, which the per-draw
 *            check counts. GAUSSIAN costs 8 % more than UNIFORM at 1 px
 *            checks (a texelFetch).
 *            SIMPLEX (v0.10): 3D simplex gradient noise, summed over
 *            octaves (fBm): octave k has lattice cells of scale / lacunarity^k
 *            units and weight gain^k, the weights summing to 1. scale is
 *            the lattice cell (deg or px, as other units); z the third
 *            coordinate in cells: bind it (noise_z) to make the field
 *            evolve; the field decorrelates over half a cell of z (r 0.92
 *            at 0.1 cells, 0.60 at 0.25, 0.07 at 0.5). The seed changes
 *            every octave's lattice keys. Values in [-1, 1]; the SD is
 *            0.425 for one octave and 0.317, 0.278, 0.261, 0.249, 0.246 for
 *            2, 3, 4, 6, 8 octaves (lacunarity 2, gain 0.5): contrast scales
 *            it. NOT BAND-LIMITED: one octave's power spreads from about
 *            1/8 to 2 times the lattice frequency (peak at 0.64 of it) with
 *            tails, and the cube-edge gradients make it anisotropic (the
 *            power of 12 angle sectors 0.93 to 1.10 of their mean,
 *            measured). For a stated band,
 *            use filtered noise (an IMAGE of noise filtered on the CPU) or
 *            gratings. Exact: ygfx_simplex_value(g, s, ix, iy) gives the
 *            GPU's value, bit for bit, at pixel (ix, iy) of a box not
 *            turned and on whole px (any ori: the same noise, sampled at
 *            turned points). The lattice repeats every 65536 cells in x and
 *            y, and z is used modulo 65536 cells. Refused: scale <= 0, a
 *            cell finer than 1/32 px at the last octave or above 32768 px,
 *            octaves outside 1..8, lacunarity outside 1..8, gain outside
 *            (0, 1], a POLYGON aperture (its vertices and the octaves share
 *            the block; MASK_TEX does that shape). Cost per octave about
 *            1.6 ms full screen at 1920 x 1200 (Iris Xe; STATUS): size the
 *            box, and render a static field once in a setup pass.
 *   USER     a pipeline from ygfx_pipeline() (SHADER CONTRACT).
 *   TEXT     a curve run (CURVE RUNS): glyphs or paths of a curve set at
 *            the caller's pen positions; layout is the pack tool's or
 *            Skribidi's. The MSDF glyph run (GLYPH RUNS) stays.
 *   MASK_TEX (any kind's shape) the signed-distance texture `mask` (R16F
 *            or R32F, distance in texels, negative inside, with padding),
 *            fitted to the box: px per texel = box width / texture width.
 *            A box of another aspect ratio than the texture's is refused.
 *            Nothing outside the box is drawn: the padding holds what an
 *            outer stroke or a soft edge reaches. ygfx_sdf_from_mask()
 *            makes one from a mask; ygfx_hit() does not see masks. MSDF
 *            and MTSDF atlases and a mask's src rectangle: DISTANCE
 *            TEXTURES.
 *   EDGES (edge, edge_width in px), centered on the nominal boundary, so
 *   the coverage is 0.5 at the stated size:
 *     HARD      1 where the pixel center is inside, else 0. No smoothing.
 *     COSINE    raised cosine from 1 to 0 over edge_width.
 *     GAUSSIAN  the hard edge blurred by a Gaussian of SD edge_width:
 *               0.5 erfc(d / (edge_width sqrt 2)).
 *   The edge sets the stimulus's spatial-frequency content, so state it.
 *   What the profile is, exactly: coverage = F(d), F the profile and d the
 *   signed distance to the boundary. Two limits (measured in the test
 *   against references that share none of this arithmetic; docs/gfx.md):
 *     F(d) is the Gaussian blur of the shape only on a straight edge. At a
 *       vertex of interior angle a the blur is a / 360 and F(0) is 0.5: 0.25
 *       of the step at a right angle, 0.333 at 60 degrees, above 1/255 of
 *       the step within 3.75 SD of a right-angled vertex. On a disc of
 *       radius R the blur is about 0.2 SD / R below F(d) at the boundary
 *       (0.041 at R = 5 SD, 0.010 at 20 SD). The same holds for COSINE.
 *     d is the Euclidean distance for every v0.2 shape, with one
 *       exception (the v0.3 kinds and operations: EXACTNESS): MITER's
 *       field (RECT, CROSS, POLYGON) is the largest distance to the
 *       edges' lines, Euclidean inside, but outside a corner a lower bound,
 *       so the outer edge is up to 0.083 of the step too high there (at 1.2
 *       SD from a right-angled corner along its bisector; above 1/255
 *       within 3.75 SD), whatever the stroke or edge width.
 *   A HARD edge needs only the sign of d: it is exact for every shape.
 *   STROKES (stroke px wide; stroke_align): the band between two offsets
 *   a1 < a2 of the boundary: CENTER -s/2..s/2, INSIDE -s..0, OUTSIDE 0..s.
 *   Its coverage is the fill's at a2 minus the fill's at a1: the hard band
 *   blurred by the same profile, so both sides get the same edge, and a
 *   band narrower than the edge never reaches 1 (as a blurred thin line
 *   does not). A stroke replaces the aperture of every kind: an outline, a
 *   grating or noise in a ring, ring dots. Joins: the SDF's own (ROUND)
 *   gives a round corner on the outside of a turn and a sharp one inside
 *   (a 4 px OUTSIDE stroke on a square has round outer corners of radius
 *   4 px). MITER keeps outer corners sharp on RECT (no corner radius), CROSS
 *   and a convex POLYGON, with a bevel where the miter would pass
 *   miter_limit times the stroke width (0 means 4, SVG's default). A right
 *   angle's miter is sqrt 2 times the width, so RECT and CROSS bevel only
 *   below a limit of 1.414.
 *   MITER on a curve, a rounded rect or a concave polygon is refused.
 *   ygfx_hit() tests the hard band.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   VECTOR SHAPES (v0.3)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   One more built-in program, the vector program, draws a SHAPE from
 *   closed-form distance functions with their gradients and arc lengths.
 *   It is always compiled. A SHAPE goes to it when it has a v0.3 kind, a
 *   POLYGON with fillets, fx, a paint other than SOLID, dashes or trim;
 *   other SHAPEs stay on v0.2's program and draw as before. Sizes are in
 *   units unless the text says px.
 *     RRECT     w x h; shape_p = the corner radii top-left, top-right,
 *               bottom-right, bottom-left.
 *     ARC       a ring segment with round ends: outer diameter w;
 *               shape_p[0] sweep (degrees), [1] thickness, [2] start
 *               (degrees, +x toward +y).
 *     PIE       a disc sector: diameter w; [0] sweep, [2] start.
 *     CAPSULE   length w, end to end; [0], [1] the radii of the left and
 *               right ends (an uneven capsule fits its box).
 *     NGON      a regular polygon: circumdiameter w; [0] sides (3 to 64),
 *               [1] corner rounding radius.
 *     STAR      outer diameter w; [0] points (3 to 64), [1] the inner
 *               radius over the outer, [2] corner rounding radius.
 *     ELLIPSE   w x h, aspect up to 20. An iteration (0xfaded's): 3, 6 or 8
 *               steps for aspects up to 2, 4.5 and 20 (distance error under
 *               1e-5 px, measured at 2:1 and 9:1).
 *     QBEZIER   path = 3 points (x, y pairs from the box center); [0] the
 *               stroke width. Drawn as chords within 0.005 px of the curve
 *               (at most 223; a curve that needs more is refused).
 *     POLYLINE  path = 2 to 224 points; [0] the width; join ROUND, MITER
 *               (with miter_limit) or BEVEL; cap BUTT, ROUND or SQUARE.
 *     POLYGON   shape_p[1] > 0 rounds every corner with a fillet of that
 *               radius, convex or concave.
 *   offset (px, every SHAPE, v0.2 kinds and glyph runs included) moves the
 *   boundary out (+) or in (-) before the stroke and the edge: a dilated
 *   or eroded shape. The quad grows with it.
 *   The block: a stimulus packs into its 256-byte block and, when its data
 *   needs it, the blocks after it (up to 247 vec4 of data: polygon
 *   vertices, path points, primitives, effects, paint). Such a stimulus is
 *   one instanced draw of its own; a vector stimulus with one block batches
 *   with its neighbors. desc.max_draws counts blocks, not draws.
 *   ygfx_hit(), _bounds() and _local() use the same field on the CPU.
 *   Three specialized copies of the vector program draw three large cases
 *   in less GPU time: an RRECT with no dashes, trim, paint or fx; a CIRCLE
 *   with dashes or trim and no paint or fx; a compound of CIRCLEs only, with
 *   no paint. Each is the same text with what its case cannot reach left
 *   out, so its pixels equal the generic program's (tested bit for bit). A
 *   draw takes one only when its quad covers 65536 px or more (256 x 256):
 *   below that, the program switch costs more CPU than the stimulus saves.
 *   They compile at open with the others (14 programs); desc.cache keeps
 *   them. An element array (INSTANCES) keeps the generic program.
 *
 *   COMPOUNDS
 *   ygfx_compound() makes a SHAPE of kind COMPOUND from an array of
 *   ygfx_prim (48 bytes each, 1 to YGFX_MAX_PRIMS = 56). Each primitive
 *   has a kind (CIRCLE, ANNULUS, RECT, RRECT, LINE, CAPSULE, CROSS, ARC,
 *   PIE, NGON, STAR, ELLIPSE), a center, w, h, ori and p[4] as shape_p, in
 *   the compound's box frame (units from the box center). The fold runs
 *   left to right: primitive i meets everything before it by its op,
 *   UNION, INTERSECT, SUBTRACT (removes primitive i), XOR, or a SMOOTH_
 *   op with blend radius k (Quilez's quadratic smooth minimum). After a
 *   smooth op the field is divided by its gradient's length, so the edge
 *   keeps its stated width through the blend (EXACTNESS). onion > 0 makes
 *   a primitive a shell |d| - onion; desc.onion does it to the result. The
 *   box places and anchors the compound; a primitive outside the box is
 *   still drawn (the quad grows to it). Keep the array alive: the stimulus
 *   points at it. Bind a primitive's float with ygfx_bind.field and the
 *   offsets in ygfx_prim_params(). There is no CSG stack: a fold is
 *   linear. A compound has no length, so no dashes or trim.
 *
 *   EFFECTS
 *   stim.fx points at a ygfx_fx (px; NULL = none). From the same field,
 *   in one pass, back to front: drop (a shadow at dx, dy screen px, behind
 *   the shape), glow (the same, at no offset), the fill or stroke, inner
 *   (a shadow inside the fill, from dx, dy), then band[0] and band[1]
 *   (outlines between offsets a1 < a2 of the boundary, on top). A shadow
 *   is the silhouette moved out by spread and blurred by sigma (0 = a
 *   hard silhouette): coverage F at offset spread, with a Gaussian F of SD
 *   sigma. It is a true blur only on straight edges (EXACTNESS).
 *   YGFX_FX_EXACT_BLUR draws a sharp RECT's (or zero-radius RRECT's) drop
 *   shadow as the exact Gaussian blur of the rect, the product of two erf.
 *   An effect with opacity 0 is off. Bind its floats with ygfx_bind.field
 *   and ygfx_fx_params(). The quad grows by each effect's reach (5 SD).
 *
 *   DASHES AND TRIM
 *   Dashes and trim run along the arc length s of a closed boundary (a
 *   stroke is then required) or along the center line of a LINE, CAPSULE,
 *   ARC, QBEZIER or POLYLINE. s runs from a start point fixed per kind,
 *   +x toward +y (clockwise on the screen); ygfx_length() gives the
 *   total in px. dash[0] and dash[1] are the dash and gap in px;
 *   dash_offset (px) moves the pattern along s, so a bound channel marches
 *   it; dash_snap fits a whole number of periods to a closed boundary.
 *   trim[0], trim[1] keep the part from start to end, as fractions of the
 *   length (0, 0 or 0, 1 = all). cap shapes the ends of dashes, of a
 *   trimmed outline and of an open path: BUTT (flat, at the end), ROUND
 *   or SQUARE (half the band width past it). A dash's soft edge across s
 *   uses the same profile as the boundary. CROSS, masks and compounds have
 *   no length: dashes or trim on them are refused.
 *
 *   PAINT
 *   stim.paint points at a ygfx_paint (NULL or SOLID = color). LINEAR
 *   runs t from x0, y0 to x1, y1; RADIAL from the center x0, y0 to the
 *   radius x1; ANGULAR around x0, y0 from x1 degrees, clockwise; all in
 *   units of the box frame. 2 to 6 stops, t rising; repeat wraps t, else
 *   it is clamped. VERTEX gives each vertex of a convex POLYGON a color,
 *   mixed by Wachspress coordinates (barycentric on a triangle). The
 *   space is where colors mix: RGB (linear device RGB; XYZ, LMS and
 *   Cartesian DKL are maps of it and mix the same), OKLAB (ysp/color.h's
 *   Oklab: the calibration's absolute XYZ, black included, against the
 *   display's white; needs a calibration with chromaticities) or
 *   DKL_POLAR (elevation, azimuth and radius about the background, with
 *   desc.cones and desc.lum; needs a calibration with spectra; the azimuth
 *   takes the shorter turn between stops). Stops convert on the
 *   CPU; the shader mixes in the space and converts back per pixel. A
 *   path between in-gamut stops can leave the gamut in a nonlinear space:
 *   the CPU samples 64 points between neighbors and counts it as clipped.
 *
 *   BLEND
 *   stim.blend sets how a color stimulus meets the scene, in linear light:
 *   OVER (the default, premultiplied: an occluder), ADD (rgb += color x
 *   coverage x opacity: superposed light; alpha unchanged) or MULTIPLY
 *   (rgb = dst (1 - a + a color), a = coverage x opacity: a filter).
 *   Modulation stimuli add already: blend on them, and on an ADD image, is
 *   refused. A stimulus with another blend does not batch with its
 *   neighbors. The gamut check is v0.2's: per draw, overlaps not counted.
 *
 *   DISTANCE TEXTURES
 *   texture_desc.sdf marks a texture as a distance atlas for MASK_TEX:
 *   DIST (R16F or R32F, distance in texels, as v0.2), MSDF (msdfgen's
 *   multi-channel field: the median of the bilinear r, g, b; 0.5 on the
 *   edge, above it inside) or MTSDF (MSDF in rgb and the true distance in
 *   alpha, which offsets and round strokes read). MSDF and MTSDF need RGBA8,
 *   RGBA16F or RGBA32F and sdf_range, the atlas's full distance range in
 *   texels (msdf-atlas-gen's pxrange). An MSDF's offsets are mitered: a
 *   stroke with ROUND joins on it is refused (use JOIN_MITER, or MTSDF).
 *   The range rule: the atlas holds distances to range / 2 texels. What
 *   the edge (5 SD of a Gaussian, half the width of a cosine), the outer
 *   or inner part of the stroke and the offset reach must lie within
 *   (range / 2 - 1.5) texels, 1.5 texels kept for the bilinear neighbors.
 *   A draw that breaks it is refused with YGFX_ERR_RANGE and a message
 *   that gives the range it needs. src (x, y, w, h, texels from the
 *   top-left) picks one rectangle of the atlas for a mask; addresses are
 *   clamped to it, so no neighbor bleeds. The box must have the
 *   rectangle's aspect ratio: px per texel = box width / rectangle width.
 *
 *   GLYPH RUNS
 *   (The pack no longer makes MSDF atlases: its text is curve sets, CURVE
 *   RUNS. This path stays for atlases made elsewhere.)
 *   ygfx_glyphs() draws count glyphs from one atlas in one instanced
 *   draw. The buffer holds ygfx_glyph records (32 bytes): x, y, the
 *   glyph box's top-left in units from the run's box top-left, and sx, sy,
 *   sw, sh, its atlas rectangle in texels, padding included. scale is the
 *   units per atlas texel for every glyph. Edge, stroke, offset, color,
 *   opacity and blend apply to each glyph; the run places, turns and
 *   anchors as one box. The range rule holds per run. A run equals the
 *   same glyphs drawn one by one (bit for bit, measured). Layout,
 *   shaping and kerning are the caller's; bounds and hits come from the
 *   layout's metrics, not from the atlas. Coverage is an area fraction
 *   blended in linear light, so text looks thinner than text blended in
 *   sRGB; nothing corrects it.
 *
 *   EXACTNESS
 *   Two questions. Distance: is d the Euclidean signed distance? Then the
 *   coverage is exactly F(d), the stated profile. Blur: is the coverage
 *   the hard shape blurred by the kernel? For any shape, only on straight
 *   edges. The rule:
 *     1. A HARD edge needs only the sign of d: it is exact for every shape
 *        and operation (ELLIPSE, chords and textures to their stated
 *        error).
 *     2. A soft edge is exactly F(Euclidean d) for one exact primitive,
 *        filled, stroked with ROUND joins, offset or onioned; for a union
 *        of parts that stay apart by more than the edge's reach; and for
 *        dashes on straight runs.
 *     3. A soft edge is the Gaussian blur of the shape only on straight
 *        edges, and for a sharp RECT's shadow with EXACT_BLUR.
 *     4. Smooth merges never have an exact soft edge; the deviation is
 *        largest where two parts connect.
 *   Measured (llvmpipe, Iris Xe, WARP and SwiftShader agree), as the
 *   largest |coverage - reference| in units of the edge's step:
 *     exact kinds (RRECT, ARC, PIE, CAPSULE, NGON, STAR, POLYGON
 *       fillets, ELLIPSE) against F(brute-force Euclidean d)    4.9e-6
 *     QBEZIER (chords) against the curve                0.0050 px; 1.3e-3
 *     a UNION's reflex 90 degree crease (inside, a bound)     0.082
 *     a MITER corner, outside (a bound; v0.2)                 0.080
 *     SMOOTH_UNION, normalized, settled neck                  0.015
 *     SMOOTH_UNION at the moment two parts connect            0.122
 *     F(d) against the true blur: a 90 degree vertex          0.250
 *       a disc of radius 5 SD, 20 SD                          0.041, 0.010

 *     EXACT_BLUR against the erf product                      1.7e-7
 *   INTERSECT and SUBTRACT are bounds outside near a convex crease, XOR at
 *   every crease, and POLYLINE MITER and BEVEL near each turn, each about
 *   0.083 at 90 degrees (not measured separately). A non-smooth fold of
 *   exact fields already has a unit gradient, so dividing by it changes
 *   nothing there.

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CURVE SETS (v0.6)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A curve set is one font or one artwork set as quadratic Bezier curves
 *   and bands, the form of Lengyel's Slug algorithm (JCGT 6(2), 2017),
 *   implemented here from the paper. The pack tool's outline builder writes
 *   it; docs/gfx.md "Curve sets: the format" is the contract (version
 *   1). It is two arrays: texels (4 floats each: the curves) and words
 *   (uint32: a header, a glyph table, per glyph a record, band descriptors
 *   and sorted curve lists). ygfx_cset_make() checks them, uploads them as
 *   one RGBA32F and one RGBA32UI texture and, the first time, makes the text
 *   program (an open without text compiles nothing more):
 *       ygfx_cset font = ygfx_cset_make(&gfx, &(ygfx_cset_desc){
 *           .texels = pk.texels, .n_texels = pk.n_texels,
 *           .words = pk.words, .n_words = pk.n_words });
 *   Coordinates are em units (or the artwork's), y down, the origin at the
 *   glyph's origin (the pen position on the baseline). Glyph ids are the
 *   set's table indices: font glyph ids, or path indices for artwork.
 *   ygfx_cset_add() uploads glyphs the builder appended at run time,
 *   within cap_texels and cap_words given at make, between frames.
 *   ygfx_cset_check() and ygfx_cset_winding() need no gfx: the builder's
 *   own tests use them. Nonzero and even-odd fills are per glyph. The format
 *   holds no metrics: advances and line spacing are the layout's. Backward
 *   lists (flag bit 1) make the rays 18 to 27 % faster on a page (measured):
 *   the builder should write them.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CURVE RUNS (v0.6)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ygfx_crun() makes a TEXT stimulus: n ygfx_citem records, each a
 *   glyph or path of a set at a pen position, drawn in one instanced draw.
 *   A word laid out by the pack tool or Skribidi:
 *       static ygfx_citem hello[5];          // .x, .glyph from the layout
 *       ygfx_stim word = ygfx_crun(&gfx, &(ygfx_crun_desc){
 *           .set = font, .items = hello, .n = 5, .size = 48,
 *           .color = { 1, 1, 1 }, .fields = YGFX_I_GATE });
 *   size is units per set unit: the font size per em, in px or deg. The
 *   run's box is w x h, or, when both are 0, the items' extent at make
 *   (from the glyph boxes the set keeps on the CPU; shape_p[0..1] then hold
 *   its top-left in item units), so CENTER centers the ink. ygfx_citem has
 *   ygfx_inst's layout with glyph in phase's place (INSTANCES): x, y and
 *   glyph are always read; ori and scale (about the glyph box's center, as
 *   GSAP's transformOrigin "50% 50%"), contrast (opacity), gate and color
 *   (a palette position) when their YGFX_I_* bit is in fields. Every
 *   field is a float, so a letter's y or gate binds to a timeline channel
 *   with ygfx_bind.field: a staggered entrance, GSAP's gsap.from(chars,
 *   { y: 40, opacity: 0, stagger: 0.05 }), is one channel per letter field.
 *   Items given by .items are copied at each draw into INSTANCES' element
 *   buffers (desc.max_instances a frame); a page of text goes in a
 *   ygfx_buffer once (.buf, .first) and costs no copy. Artwork is the same
 *   call, one item per layer at (0, 0) with a palette color: layers stack
 *   in item order, as GL blends one draw in order.
 *   Coverage is the pixel's box filter, in linear light (text looks thinner
 *   than text blended in sRGB; nothing corrects it):
 *     exact     where the glyph is resolved (format flag bit 2: no contours
 *               overlap) and the item is not turned, or turned by quarter
 *               turns: the area of glyph intersect pixel by Green's theorem
 *               over the bands the pixel's rows meet; within 1.8e-5 of the
 *               exact coverage (measured). A false resolved bit gives wrong
 *               coverage near the overlaps, nothing worse
 *     otherwise two rays from the pixel center through the glyph's bands
 *               (Lengyel). A crossing near the pixel adds the exact box
 *               coverage of the half-plane bounded by the curve's tangent
 *               there, so a straight edge at any angle is exact; corners,
 *               curvature tighter than a pixel and self-intersections are
 *               not. The rays mix by how steeply and how near each one
 *               crosses. Measured mean edge error 0.029, 0.019, 0.009 and
 *               0.004 at 8, 12, 24 and 48 px per em, the same at every
 *               rotation; the largest 0.56, at corners. Where a ray passes a
 *               corner, a pixel's value jumps (up to 0.44 between positions
 *               0.005 px apart, measured); on a smooth outline by at most
 *               0.038
 *   The exact area costs 1.4 times the rays on a page of 12 px text and
 *   less than them at 200 px (STATUS). Which to pick: the exact area (the
 *   default) wherever text is read or measured; .rays (crun_desc.rays) for
 *   a page whose glyphs are 8 px per em or more and whose frame needs the
 *   2 ms: it costs the rays' error everywhere, a mean of 0.029, 0.019,
 *   0.009 and 0.004 on edge pixels at 8, 12, 24 and 48 px per em and up
 *   to 0.56 at corners, against 1.8e-5. The first .rays run compiles the
 *   rays program (about 150 ms): make it at setup. Turned runs take the
 *   rays program by themselves (v0.8): a run draws on it, with the same
 *   bits as on the exact-area program, when no item can take the exact
 *   area there: the run is aliased, or its turn (with a group's) is 0.01
 *   degrees or more from a quarter turn and it has no YGFX_I_ORI, or it
 *   has YGFX_I_ORI, its items on the CPU, and every item's turn plus the
 *   run's is 0.01 degrees or more from one. Items in a buffer with
 *   YGFX_I_ORI stay on the exact-area program (their turns are on the
 *   GPU only), as does a run made before the rays program existed. Static
 *   text (a reading page) belongs in a target, drawn once, in a setup pass
 *   (SETUP PASSES): an RGBA16F target of the
 *   screen's size (18.4 MB at 1920 x 1200; RGBA32F 36.9 MB) drawn as an
 *   image at 1:1 on whole px costs 0.5 ms against 7.5 ms and has the run's
 *   coverage bit for bit (the text program computes each pixel's em point
 *   in px with y down, the same in a target as in the scene). Draw a run
 *   directly only when it moves, turns, scales or animates per letter: a
 *   cached texture drawn off the pixel grid or scaled is interpolated and
 *   no longer the exact coverage. A page rendered in a setup pass equals
 *   one rendered in a frame, bit for bit. The fill rule maps each ray's
 *   fractional winding to coverage: exact while a pixel sees one
 *   transition. .aliased gives 0 or 1 from the winding at the pixel center.
 *   Edge profiles, strokes, offsets, dashes, fx and paint are refused on a
 *   run: the outline builder expands outlines and bold into fills; soft
 *   edges, glow and shadow come from BLUR. A hard shadow is a second draw
 *   of the same run, offset and recolored. Blend OVER, ADD or MULTIPLY, as
 *   color stimuli. ygfx_hit() on a run is the winding at the pixel center
 *   from the set's arrays when the set was made with .keep (it agrees with
 *   aliased coverage), else the glyph boxes; ygfx_hit_index() gives the
 *   topmost item (artwork: the layer); items in a buffer are on the GPU
 *   only, so neither sees them. In the reorder a run's bounds are the whole
 *   pass.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BLUR (v0.6)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A separable Gaussian blur of a layer, a target you draw into, into a
 *   result you draw as an image: soft shadows, glow, blurred-letter
 *   stimuli. CSS's text-shadow: 0 0 3px gold:
 *       static ygfx_blur glow;                              // setup
 *       ygfx_blur_make(&gfx, &glow, &(ygfx_blur_desc){ .w = 800, .h = 240,
 *                        .format = YGFX_R16F, .sigma = 3 });
 *       ygfx_begin_target(&gfx, glow.layer, NULL);          // in a frame
 *       ygfx_draw(&gfx, &word_white);                       // at the layer's center
 *       ygfx_end_target(&gfx);
 *       ygfx_blur_apply(&gfx, &glow);
 *       glow.image.tint[0] = 1; glow.image.tint[1] = 0.8f; glow.image.tint[2] = 0.2f;
 *       ygfx_draw(&gfx, &glow.image);                       // the glow
 *       ygfx_draw(&gfx, &word);                             // the sharp word on top
 *   The layer keeps the sharp content: draw it once and apply the blur each
 *   frame with a sigma bound to a channel (ygfx_bind.field = &glow.sigma),
 *   and only the two passes cost. Place the word at the layer's center and
 *   the image where the word is. The rules:
 *     two passes, horizontal into a scratch target, vertical into the
 *       result, in call order; they count as 2 of the 16 passes;
 *     direct taps within 5 SD, weights exp(-x^2 / 2 s^2) normalized in f32;
 *       a BOX source (the default: curve runs, antialiased edges) has the
 *       box filter's variance, 1/12 px^2, taken out of sigma; POINT sources
 *       (gratings) do not;
 *     outside the layer is empty: content within 5 sigma of its edge loses
 *       the mass that falls outside, as on an empty screen;
 *     formats: R16F (a coverage mask: draw white into it; the image is
 *       tint.rgb with coverage times tint.a), RGBA16F (premultiplied
 *       color), RGBA32F (needs EXT_float_blend for the draws into the
 *       layer; ANGLE on D3D11 hardware, WARP and SwiftShader and Mesa
 *       llvmpipe have it, and EXT_color_buffer_float, which open requires);
 *     supersample 2 (opt-in): the layer is 2w x 2h and draws into it see
 *       twice the px per unit (fields in px are layer px); the passes take
 *       taps on the 2x grid at each result pixel's center. The error at
 *       sigma 0.5 to 2 falls 4 to 5 times (measured), at a cost given in
 *       STATUS;
 *     sigma above the box's own SD (0.29 px; POINT: above 0) and at most
 *       32 px of the result. The error is the 1x sampling's: 0.20 at sigma
 *       0.5, 0.031 at 1, 0.0087 at 2, 0.0022 at 4 (RGBA32F, against the
 *       exact blur of a rect; docs/gfx.md);
 *     the cost grows with the layer's pixels and sigma: size the layer to
 *       the stimulus, not the screen.
 *   A blur is of linear light: the physical blur of the displayed pattern.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PROGRAM CACHE (v0.4)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Each built-in program costs ANGLE 0.15 to 0.75 s to compile at open.
 *   desc.cache keeps the compiled programs: a pair of calls that load and
 *   store bytes under a 64-bit key, in storage the caller owns. ysp_gfx
 *   reads or writes no file unless the caller gives a cache that does:
 *       static ygfx_file_cache pc;
 *       char dir[512];
 *       if (ygfx_default_cache_dir(dir, sizeof dir) == YGFX_OK)
 *           desc.cache = ygfx_file_cache_init(&pc, dir);
 *   ygfx_default_cache_dir() gives the per-user cache folder (v0.10.1;
 *   from v0.10.2 it is yrt_user_dir(YRT_DIR_CACHE, "progcache"), ysp/rt.h
 *   PER-USER FOLDERS, with the same rules). It makes no folder; on POSIX it reads the owner and mode of the parts
 *   of the path that exist.
 *     Windows  %LOCALAPPDATA%\ysp\progcache (read with the wide API, given
 *              as UTF-8)
 *     Linux    $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ysp/progcache when that is an absolute path,
 *              else $HOME/.cache/ysp/progcache
 *     macOS    $HOME/Library/Caches/ysp/progcache
 *   It fails (YGFX_ERR_ARG, out empty) when the variable is missing or
 *   not absolute, when the path does not fit, on the web, and on POSIX
 *   when a part of the path that exists can be written by all users or
 *   belongs to another user (not root). Then use no cache. Never fall
 *   back to a shared folder such as /tmp: the entry hash finds damage, not
 *   attack. Anyone who can write the folder can put an entry with a
 *   correct hash there, and the GL driver parses that binary in the
 *   experiment's process. Give ygfx_file_cache_init() only a folder that
 *   the user alone can write.
 *   The key covers the GL vendor, renderer (ANGLE puts the adapter and the
 *   driver version in it), version (the ANGLE build) and GLSL strings, the
 *   binary format and the program's whole text. An entry is a 48-byte
 *   header (the key, a second hash of the key's material and its length,
 *   a hash of the binary) and the driver's binary. An entry is used only
 *   when all of it matches; anything else is compiled from source and
 *   stored again: a miss, a damaged or truncated entry, a key collision,
 *   another driver's entry, a binary the driver refuses. ANGLE links a
 *   binary with a byte changed and crashed on half a binary (measured), so
 *   the hash is what keeps a damaged entry from the driver. The file cache
 *   writes each entry whole under a temporary name and renames it; it
 *   never deletes, so each ANGLE build and driver pair adds about 0.5 MB
 *   until the folder is emptied by hand. ygfx_program_stats() and the
 *   describe line give what the open did. The describe line names the
 *   folder of a ygfx_file_cache ("program cache <folder>: N hit / M
 *   miss (R rejected)"; a rejected entry is also a miss), or says
 *   "(caller)" for another cache and "off" for none; "(unused: no binary
 *   format)" follows when the backend has no program binaries (the null
 *   backend, WebGL). User pipelines, the video program and
 *   the instanced programs use the same cache. WebGL has no
 *   binaries: the cache is then unused (YGFX_FEAT_PROGRAM_CACHE clear).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   VIDEO (v0.4)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   YGFX_NV12 and YGFX_I420 textures hold 8-bit 4:2:0 video as planes
 *   (Y w x h; chroma ceil(w / 2) x ceil(h / 2)). ygfx_image() draws them
 *   as color images, converted per pixel to linear light by texture_desc.
 *   enc, which a planar texture must state in full (rig_spec principles 4
 *   and 5: nothing is assumed):
 *     matrix     BT601, BT709 or BT2020 (non-constant luminance)
 *     range      LIMITED (Y' 16..235, C 16..240) or FULL (C = (code - 128)
 *                / 255)
 *     transfer   DEVICE: the R'G'B' codes are device values; they go
 *                through the display's own transfer (the inverse of the
 *                CLUT, a 256-entry table made at open), so the output stage
 *                writes each code back, calibration or not (all 256 codes
 *                tested). BT1886 (V^2.4, black at the display's black),
 *                SRGB, LINEAR (values are linear already) or GAMMA22.
 *     primaries  DEVICE passes the source's RGB through as the display's,
 *                stated. BT709, BT601_525, BT601_625 or BT2020 convert
 *                through the calibration's chromaticities (relative: the
 *                source's D65 white at Y = 1 goes to the display's white,
 *                no chromatic adaptation); without a calibration that has
 *                them, refused. Light out of gamut is clamped by the scene,
 *                not counted.
 *     siting     LEFT (MPEG-2, H.264, HEVC: co-sited across, between rows),
 *                CENTER (MPEG-1, JPEG) or TOP_LEFT. Chroma is interpolated
 *                at that point, bilinear and clamped to its plane (at 1:1,
 *                the same weights as ysp/video.h's sixteenths), or
 *                replicated with chroma_nearest.
 *   R'G'B' is clamped to 0..1 before the transfer. An RGBA8, RGBA16F or
 *   RGBA32F texture may state an encoding too (matrix RGB), to show a frame
 *   sequence in linear light; all zero keeps the old meaning (the values
 *   are linear). The values of the YGFX_MATRIX_, _RANGE_, _TRC_, _PRIM_
 *   and _SITING_ names are ysp/video.h's. A planar texture updates by
 *   ygfx_texture_update_planes() (each plane, one call) or
 *   ygfx_texture_update_plane() (a rectangle of one plane).
 *   ygfx_texture_import() wraps a texture ysp_gfx did not make: a GL
 *   texture of this context, or on Windows a D3D11 texture on ANGLE's
 *   device (yscr_native()), RGBA or NV12, a slice of an array included
 *   (EGL_ANGLE_image_d3d11_texture; its filters are set to NEAREST). A
 *   texture shared from another D3D11 device is opened on ANGLE's device by
 *   its handle first; the caller orders the producer's write before the
 *   frame: a keyed mutex acquired before ygfx_end() and released after
 *   the flip, or the producer's flush and a query it waits on (both read
 *   back exactly). ygfx_texture_rebind(t, src) makes t show src's texels
 *   with no GL call, so a movie's stimulus keeps its handle while the
 *   decoder's surfaces rotate. The video program compiles at the first
 *   encoded texture: an open without video costs nothing more.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   INSTANCES (v0.4)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   One template stimulus and an array of ygfx_inst elements draw in one
 *   call (a gabor array, an element field, a search display):
 *       static ygfx_inst items[400];
 *       ygfx_inst_grid(items, 20, 20, 1.5f, 1.5f);          // deg
 *       for (i = 0; i < 400; i++) items[i].ori = random_ori();
 *       ygfx_stim gab = ygfx_gabor(&(ygfx_gabor_desc){ .sf = 4, .sigma = 0.15f });
 *       ygfx_stim field = ygfx_instances(&gfx, &gab, &(ygfx_instances_desc){
 *           .inst = items, .n = 400, .fields = YGFX_I_XY | YGFX_I_ORI });
 *       ygfx_draw(&gfx, &field);
 *       int k = ygfx_hit_index(&gfx, &field, mouse_x, mouse_y);   // which one
 *   Element i is the template with: its anchor moved by (x, y) units along
 *   the template's turned axes; its box turned by ori and scaled by scale
 *   about that anchor (as a group's scale: what is in px, edge_width,
 *   stroke, offset, does not scale); phase added; contrast multiplying
 *   contrast and opacity; gate multiplying gate; color a position in the
 *   palette (up to 16 rgb entries: color for a color stimulus, the tint for
 *   an image, dir for a modulation, used as given), where an integer gives
 *   that entry bit for bit and a fraction mixes two neighbors in linear
 *   light. Only the fields in .fields are read. Templates: SHAPE (vector
 *   kinds whose data fits their block), GRATING, GABOR, NOISE (no scale:
 *   its check is px), IMAGE and USER (the body sees its own px and ysp_size
 *   scaled, as in a group); not DOTS or glyph runs (instanced already) or
 *   a stimulus with extension blocks. A template field moves every element
 *   (a ygfx_bind on the stimulus); ygfx_bind.field on items[k] moves
 *   one. draw() copies the elements into the frame's buffer: up to
 *   desc.max_instances (16384 by default) a frame; past it the draw is
 *   refused with YGFX_ERR_FULL, and nothing of it is drawn.
 *   ygfx_hit_index() gives the topmost element (the highest index) under
 *   a pixel by the CPU's field, skipping gate 0; ygfx_inst_resolve() an
 *   element's anchor. The gamut check covers the template, not each
 *   element. Element angles come from a polynomial in degrees (D3D's sin
 *   and cos are coarse): within 4.4e-7 of double.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   OUTPUT STAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CLUT     n entries per channel from linear to device value (2 to
 *            4096), interpolated linearly by hand from two texel fetches,
 *            so no filtering extension is involved. Identity (n = 2) without
 *            a calibration: then a scene value is a device value.
 *            ygfx_set_lut() replaces it between frames.
 *   DITHER   code = floor(v * 255 + t), t = 0.5 (NONE, rounding), a Bayer
 *            8 x 8 threshold (ORDERED), or a hash of pixel, frame index and
 *            seed (NOISE, a new pattern each frame). The pattern is the
 *            scene's pixel grid from its bottom-left corner. Its spectrum
 *            is part of the stimulus; the default is NONE.
 *   GAMUT    the scene is clamped to 0..1. Each draw is checked on the CPU
 *            (bg +- contrast * gate * |dir| for modulations, the color for
 *            color stimuli); a draw that may leave 0..1 is counted
 *            (ygfx_clipped) and a frame with one pushes a CLIPPED record.
 *            Overlaps are not counted.
 *   10 BIT, MONO++, COLOR++, STEREO
 *            declared and refused in v0.1 (STATUS).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CALIBRATION
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The calibration is ysp/color.h's ycol_cal (the .yspcal file, the same
 *   bytes as v0.4's ygfx_cal): readings, spectra, derive(), the CLUT and
 *   the matrices into XYZ and cone space; its manual has the recipe.
 *   desc.cal gives it to open(), which checks it (ycol_cal_check()),
 *   uploads its CLUT and makes PAINT's spaces and the video primaries from
 *   it. Without it a scene value is a device value. For colors, cone
 *   contrast and DKL directions (stim.dir), gamut questions and gamut
 *   mapping, use ygfx_color(g): the ysp/color.h context (ycol_ctx)
 *   open() made with desc.background, desc.cones and desc.lum, the one
 *   PAINT uses. v0.4's calls are
 *   ysp/color.h's raw layer under new names, the same bits:
 *   ycol_cal_dir_cone(), ycol_cal_dkl_matrix(), ycol_cal_dir_dkl(),
 *   ycol_dkl_from_sph(), ycol_max_contrast(),
 *   ycol_cone_fundamentals(YCOL_CONES_SS2, nm, lms).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SHADER CONTRACT
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A user shader is GLSL ES 3.00: one function and its helpers.
 *       float ysp_main(vec2 p)   MODULATION: g(p) in [-1, 1]
 *       vec4  ysp_main(vec2 p)   COLOR: linear rgb and coverage
 *       vec3  ysp_main(vec2 p)   ADD: an rgb increment
 *   p is the fragment's point in the stimulus's own frame, pixels from its
 *   box center, along its axes (x along ori, y a quarter turn clockwise
 *   from it on the screen), computed from gl_FragCoord and the exact
 *   center: interpolated coordinates moved with the rasterizer's subpixel
 *   snapping, up to 2e-2 of full scale on SwiftShader (docs/gfx.md).
 *   The wrapper applies the aperture and edge, contrast, gate, dir or
 *   opacity, and the blend. Available to the body:
 *       ysp_param(k)    the stimulus's p[k], k 0..31
 *       ysp_size        half box w, h (px), pixels per unit, quad margin
 *       ysp_look        contrast, opacity, gate, the stroke band's center
 *                       offset px (ysp_shape.w is its half width)
 *       ysp_color, ysp_dir, ysp_xf, ysp_edge, ysp_shape, ysp_misc
 *       ysp_target      target w, h, 1/w, 1/h
 *       ysp_time        onset s since open (float: 0.24 ms steps at 1 h),
 *                       period s, frame index, 0
 *       ysp_seed        uvec4: frame index low, high, desc.seed, vblank
 *       ysp_hash(uint)  the integer hash of NOISE (triple32 from v0.9)
 *       ysp_hash2(uvec2, uint)  NOISE's key of a point under a seed (v0.9)
 *       ysp_tex0..2, ysp_utex0 (unsigned), ysp_PI, ysp_sdf, ysp_sdf_at,
 *       ysp_coverage, ysp_aperture, ysp_bilinear (four texelFetch,
 *       clamped to a rectangle)
 *   Identifiers with two underscores in a row are reserved in GLSL (ANGLE
 *   warns): the contract has none.
 *   The wrapper puts "#line 1" before the body, so the compiler's log
 *   names the body's lines. ygfx_shader_wrap() gives the fragment
 *   shader text without GL: the pack tool validates exactly that.
 *   A time-dependent pattern takes its phase in ysp_param() from the CPU,
 *   not from ysp_time. A slow shader is its writer's timing problem, and
 *   the flip record's phases are where it shows.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BACKENDS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ygfx_backend (version 3) is a table of 19 calls (pipelines from
 *   shader text, textures, buffers, passes, apply, draw, present, read,
 *   reset, pipeline_finish, pipeline_binary): the gfx backend of the rig's
 *   extensions. Version 3 (v0.4) asks an out-of-tree backend for: the caps
 *   strings vendor, version and glsl and binary_format (0: no binaries);
 *   pipeline_src.binary (try it, compile vs and fs when the driver refuses
 *   it) with pipeline_make returning 1 when the binary was used; a
 *   pipeline_binary call, or NULL; texture_src.gl_name and .d3d11, .plane,
 *   .slice (wrap, not make; NOT_IMPLEMENTED is a fine answer);
 *   bindings.tex[6] (units 4 and 5: the video program's Cr plane and the
 *   display's transfer table); bindings.instances_off (the first record);
 *   and caps.features (YGFX_FEAT_IMPORT_*). A backend that copies the
 *   built-in table and changes some calls, as the tests do, needs none of
 *   this.
 *   open() starts every built-in program with pipeline_src.deferred set,
 *   then calls pipeline_finish on each: a driver that compiles in parallel
 *   (ANGLE does) then overlaps them. A backend without it sets
 *   pipeline_finish NULL and completes each pipeline_make. bindings.blend
 *   overrides a pipeline's blend for one draw (BLEND). The built-in one is GL ES 3.0 through
 *   yscr_gl_proc() (or desc.gl_proc, headless); on a screen with no GL
 *   (SIM) the null backend runs everything and draws nothing. A backend
 *   gets and returns rows bottom-up, GL's order.
 *   On DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION, ANGLE's client-buffer pbuffer puts GL's
 *   row 0 at the top of the screen (measured); the output stage writes
 *   the rows in that order. desc.rows overrides it for a custom presenter.
 *   GL state is cached and set only where it changes. Another program's GL
 *   calls between frames make the cache wrong: call ygfx_reset_state()
 *   after them. A ysp/screen.h present callback is followed for you: the
 *   cache is dropped whenever yscr_gl_epoch() has moved (checked on entry
 *   to every call that issues GL). When yscr_gl_generation() has moved,
 *   the context is new and every GL object is gone: that call returns
 *   YGFX_ERR_LOST and the handle closes without deleting anything (the
 *   old names could name the new context's objects). Call ygfx_close(),
 *   then ygfx_open() and make the resources again.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   THE RING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   With desc.ring, source YRT_SRC_GFX:
 *     YGFX_EV_OPEN     at open: aux scene format; u.u32[0..6] CLUT n,
 *                        dither, output, calibration CRC, its flags, w, h;
 *                        [7] programs from desc.cache, [8] compiled, [9]
 *                        open() in ms
 *     YGFX_EV_LUT      at ygfx_set_lut(): u.u32[0] n, [1] CRC-32 of it
 *     YGFX_EV_CLIPPED  a frame with clipped draws only: t_ns its onset,
 *                        aux the count, u.i64[0] the frame index
 *     YGFX_EV_COLOR    at open, with a calibration: u.u32[0] the color
 *                        context's id, [1] the calibration's CRC, [2] the
 *                        lum record's CRC (0 = the standard luminance),
 *                        [3] cones, [4] the context's YCOL_CAN_* levels
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   open() allocates once (the frame's uniform staging and queue,
 *   max_draws x 296 bytes plus 4 KB of slack for one stimulus's extension
 *   blocks and 4.25 KB of frame blocks, one per target pass, 304 KB by
 *   default, and the shader text while it compiles); nothing after it
 *   (measured in v0.1: no C runtime heap call in the frame loop).
 *   v0.4: the first ygfx_instances() allocates the element staging
 *   (desc.max_instances x 32 bytes, 512 KB by default) and three element
 *   buffers of that size on the GPU; the first encoded texture compiles the
 *   video program; a user pipeline keeps a copy of its body for its
 *   instanced program. The frame loop still allocates nothing.
 *   v0.6: ygfx_cset_make() allocates the set's box table (16 bytes a
 *   glyph) and makes its two textures, and the first one compiles the text
 *   program; ygfx_crun() with items allocates INSTANCES' element staging
 *   when it is not there; ygfx_blur_make() makes three targets (layer,
 *   scratch, result) and the first one compiles the blur program. A frame
 *   with runs and blurs allocates nothing.
 *   v0.7: open makes NOISE GAUSSIAN's table texture (256 x 256 R32F, 256
 *   KB) from a static table of the same size, built once per process with
 *   256 KB of static scratch; a run made with .rays compiles the rays
 *   program once.
 *   The handle is about 23 KB on 64-bit targets. A target pass takes no memory of its own;
 *   ygfx_target() makes its texture and framebuffer at setup. One thread
 *   calls everything, the thread that owns the screen's context. Textures,
 *   buffers and pipelines are made and updated between frames, never
 *   between begin() and end().
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   As ysp/screen.h: link SDL3, put ANGLE's libEGL.dll and libGLESv2.dll
 *   beside the program on Windows. With YSCR_NO_SDL it builds without SDL
 *   and runs headless on a GL ES 3.0 context you make (desc.gl_proc) or on
 *   a custom presenter (tests/adapt/gfx_headless.h makes one on EGL:
 *   ANGLE's D3D11, WARP or SwiftShader on Windows, Mesa on Linux). Link
 *   libm on Linux. Define YGFX_API to change the linkage.
 *   Zones: ygfx.begin, ygfx.draw, ygfx.end, ygfx.output,
 *   ygfx.upload.
 *
 *   LICENSE: public domain / MIT-0, with the MIT-licensed parts named at
 *   the top; all notices are at the end of the file.
