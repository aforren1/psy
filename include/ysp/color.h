/* ysp/color.h - v0.1.0 - public domain single-header color library for
 *   calibrated displays
 *
 *   Color for psychophysics on a measured display: the display calibration
 *   (photometer readings in, a lookup table and the matrices into CIE 1931
 *   XYZ and cone space out, a canonical file), a conversion context, color
 *   values tagged with their space, conversions in both directions between
 *   linear device RGB and XYZ, xyY, CIELAB, CIELUV, Oklab, sRGB, Display P3,
 *   Rec. 2020, cone excitations, cone contrast, DKL and MacLeod-Boynton,
 *   gamut questions (in gamut by how much, the largest contrast along a
 *   direction, the gamut boundary in a plane), gamut mapping by a stated
 *   method, and a participant's luminance from flicker photometry.
 *
 *   Three rules hold for every call. A conversion goes through a
 *   calibration: measured, or nominal and flagged, never an assumed sRGB
 *   display. A color outside the gamut comes back unclipped, with its
 *   distance. A conversion that the calibration cannot support is refused,
 *   with a message that names what is missing.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no OS calls, no threads, no heap, no I/O. Needs nothing
 *   but libm. Not a transport header, so it does not include ysp/rt.h.
 *   C99 is the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect
 *   MSVC compiles by default. The YCOL_<SPACE>(...) value macros are
 *   designated initializers: C99, or C++20.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.1.0 - first version. The calibration (ycol_cal, the .yspcal
 *          file) is ysp/gfx.h v0.4's ygfx_cal, field for field and byte
 *          for byte, with its code; ysp/gfx.h v0.5 uses this header
 *          (docs/color.md). The gamut tolerance is 2^-20, the
 *          precision of the calibration's float storage (GAMUT). New: the
 *          context, the color
 *          values, the conversions, the gamut calls, the 10 degree cone
 *          fundamentals, the participant luminance record (ycol_lum,
 *          the .ysplum file) and nominal spectra.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.1.0. Built and run with MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX, the default
 *   C dialect and C++17), MinGW-w64 gcc 14.3 (C99, C11, C++17) and gcc
 *   11.4 on Linux under ASan and UBSan; the value macros as C++20 on MSVC
 *   and g++. tests/adapt/color_test.c checks:
 *   - the calibration against published values, as ysp/gfx.h v0.3 did:
 *     IEC 61966-2-1's sRGB matrix within 3.9e-5, the CLUT of an sRGB
 *     transfer within 1.3e-3 (17 levels) and 3.6e-5 (64), RGB to LMS, the
 *     DKL matrix and its axes within 7e-8 (relative) of Psychtoolbox's
 *     ComputeDKL_M in MATLAB R2023a; the 10 degree table against CVRL's
 *     rows through colour-science;
 *   - the conversions against colour-science 0.4.7
 *     (tests/compare/color_refs.py): XYZ, xyY, Oklab, Display P3 and Rec.
 *     2020 within 4e-16, CIELAB and CIELUV within 9e-14, the polar forms
 *     within 1.4e-12 (3.3e-10 for the hue of a near-gray), Bradford 1e-16;
 *   - round trips through every space on three contexts, 20000 colors
 *     each: within 1.4e-13 (DKL spherical) and 8.4e-15 for the rest;
 *   - gamut edges, max_scale against a bisection (1.1e-15), the rings,
 *     every map method on 2000 colors (results in gamut, L and h kept
 *     within 3.3e-16 and 2.3e-12 degrees), device codes through the CLUT
 *     and back (0 of 3840 differ), rounding at 0.002 of a code;
 *   - the luminance fit on a synthetic observer (the weights' direction
 *     within 1e-15), every refusal, the parameter tables.
 *   Before ysp/gfx.h v0.5 took its calibration from this header, a build
 *   of the test with ysp/gfx.h v0.4 beside it compared the two codes bit
 *   for bit: 52 calibrations (struct, file bytes, check), 2100 raw calls,
 *   PAINT's matrices and forward conversions, the video primaries; equal.
 *   After the move, ysp_gfx's test gives the same readback hashes.
 *   A calibration from float literals hashes to the same bits on all three
 *   compilers. 32 deliberate faults in the header, 32 caught.
 *   Against Psychtoolbox in MATLAB R2023a (tests/compare/color_ptb.m,
 *   through the MEX binding): ComputeDKL_M within 6.2e-16 with the
 *   standard and a participant's luminance; LMSToMacBoyn within 1.2e-7
 *   (its fitted luminance weights against the published ones);
 *   SensorToPrimary within 1.5e-8 and SensorToSettings's out-of-gamut
 *   flags equal on 500 colors; MaximizeGamutContrast within 7.3e-16.
 *   Cost (examples/color/bench.c, MSVC 19.44 /O2, the Iris Xe laptop,
 *   power source not recorded): a
 *   DKL direction 22 to 27 ns a call, CIELAB and Oklab from RGB 40 to 44
 *   ns, an OkLCh gamut ring of 360 hues 0.8 to 1.0 ms, a context 0.6 to
 *   0.8 ms; MinGW's pow and cbrt are 2 to 5 times slower.
 *   What is NOT done here: no number is a measurement of light.
 *   docs/color.md has the tables.

 *
 *       ycol_gamut g;

 *       if (!g.in) printf("out by %.3g; %.3g of it fits\n", g.distance, g.scale);
 *       double kmax = ycol_max_scale(&cx, YCOL_DKL(.azim = 0, .contrast = 1),
 *                                      YCOL_SYMMETRIC);

 *       ycol_rgb soft   = ycol_map(&cx, YCOL_OKLCH(.L = 0.75, .C = 0.2, .h = 30),
 *                                      YCOL_MAP_CHROMA_OKLCH, &g);

 *       ycol_store3f(stim.dir, d);    // ysp/gfx.h takes float[3]
 *
 *   A value macro needs at least one field: YCOL_DKL() expands to empty
 *   braces, which C99 refuses. In C++17, which has no designated
 *   initializers, use ycol_make(YCOL_SPACE_DKL, elev, azim, contrast).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   LINEAR DEVICE RGB
 *     Per gun 0..1, proportional to that gun's light above the display's
 *     black: ysp/gfx.h's scene value. The gamut is the cube [0, 1]^3.
 *   THE CALIBRATION HAS THREE LEVELS
 *     readings (Y per gun and level, a black)   RGB, DEVICE
 *     + chromaticities x, y at level 1 per gun, and for a black with
 *       light (YCOL_CAL_HAS_XY)               XYZ and every space made
 *                                               from it (CIE 1931 2 degree)
 *     + the primaries' spectra
 *       (YCOL_CAL_HAS_SPECTRA)                LMS and every cone space
 *     A conversion that needs a level the calibration lacks is refused
 *     with YCOL_ERR_REFUSED and a message. There is no CIE 1931 to cone
 *     approximation: one measured 7 to 16 percent S-cone leak on a DKL
 *     L-M axis (docs/color.md).
 *   THE CONTEXT
 *     ycol_ctx holds one calibration, one cone observer, one luminance
 *     definition, one background and one reference white, and the
 *     matrices derived from them. A calibration alone cannot answer a DKL
 *     question (it needs a background and a luminance) or a CIELAB one (it
 *     needs a white). The context is the unit to log:
 *     ycol_ctx_describe() gives one line, ctx.id a 32-bit CRC of all of
 *     it. Read-only after init, so threads can share one.
 *   ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE
 *     XYZ, xyY and LMS are absolute: the light at the eye, the display's
 *     black included (measure the black in the room light of the
 *     experiment). CIELAB, CIELUV and Oklab take that absolute XYZ against
 *     the reference white: desc.white, or by default the XYZ of device
 *     (1, 1, 1), black included. Oklab divides by the white's Y and uses
 *     Ottosson's M1 with no chromatic adaptation, unless desc.adapt is
 *     BRADFORD: then the white maps to D65 first.
 *   D65 SOURCES
 *     sRGB, Display P3 and Rec. 2020 values are encoded values of a D65
 *     space: decoded by the space's transfer function (sign kept), taken
 *     to XYZ by the matrix made from the space's primaries and D65, then
 *     shown on this display. desc.src_white_Y = 0 (the default): relative,
 *     the source's white has the display's white luminance and the
 *     source's black is the display's black (ysp/gfx.h's video choice).
 *     desc.src_white_Y > 0: absolute, the source's white has that many
 *     cd/m2, and its black is XYZ 0, below the display's black. desc.adapt
 *     BRADFORD maps D65 onto the display's white; NONE (the default)
 *     keeps D65's chromaticity. ycol_ctx_describe() prints the choice.
 *   CONTRAST SPACES
 *     Cone contrast, DKL (spherical and Cartesian) are about the context's
 *     background. DKL is Brainard's (1996) ComputeDKL_M as in Psychtoolbox:
 *     luminance V = w . LMS, the L-M axis keeps luminance and S, the S axis
 *     keeps L and M, and each isolating direction at a pooled cone contrast
 *     of 1 is a unit vector. Spherical: elevation 90 is +luminance, azimuth
 *     0 is +(L-M), azimuth 90 is +S, all in degrees; contrast is the radius.
 *     This is PsychoPy's convention for the angles, not for the units:
 *     PsychoPy's radius 1 is the edge of its monitor's gamut on each axis,
 *     which changes with the display. Use ycol_max_scale() for the edge.
 *   ANGLES
 *     Hue and azimuth in degrees, 0 to 360. Below a chroma of 1e-12 (or a
 *     DKL contrast of 0, or an elevation of +-90 degrees) the hue or azimuth
 *     is 0 and YCOL_F_ACHROMATIC is set on the result.

 *   String names (ycol_spaces(), ycol_format()) are "rgb", "device",

 *   "oklch", "srgb", "display-p3", "rec2020", "lms", "cone", "dkl",
 *   "dkl-cart", "mb". "cielab", not "lab": CSS's lab() has a D50 white.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   GAMUT
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ycol_to_rgb() never clips and never maps. ycol_gamut tells:
 *     in        every channel in [-eps, 1 + eps], eps = YCOL_GAMUT_EPS
 *               = 2^-20 = 9.54e-7, below 1/1000 of a 10-bit code. Why:
 *               the calibration stores its readings as float, each to a
 *               relative 2^-24 (u). The first-order error that storage
 *               puts in a device value, the sum over every stored float f
 *               of |d rgb / d f| f u, is at most 7.2 u for a nominal
 *               display with sRGB's primaries and an sRGB source at the
 *               corners of its cube (5.8 u for P3, 4.7 u for BT.2020;
 *               the test measures at most 0.9 u at those corners and 1.4
 *               u for #ff8800). eps is 16 u, over twice the largest bound,
 *               so a color the source puts on its gamut's boundary is in
 *               gamut on such a display.
 *     margin[k] min(v, 1 - v): the room to the nearer bound, negative
 *               outside; exact, no tolerance
 *     distance  max(0, -min margin): how far outside, in linear RGB
 *     scale     the largest k with bg + k (rgb - bg) inside; 1 or more is
 *               in gamut. ycol_to_dir() checks bg + dir and bg - dir.
 *   ycol_max_scale(c, sides) is the largest k that keeps k times the
 *   color's offset from the background inside: for DKL it multiplies the
 *   contrast, for CONE and DKL_CART the vector, for other spaces the line
 *   in linear RGB from the background. YCOL_SYMMETRIC checks both signs,
 *   as a grating swings. It is Psychtoolbox's MaximizeGamutContrast.
 *   ycol_max_ring() gives the boundary in a plane as n radii: DKL at an
 *   elevation, cone contrast at an elevation toward S, OkLCh or CIE LCh at
 *   a lightness (by bisection on the chroma; -1 where a gray of that
 *   lightness is outside).
 *   ycol_map() brings a color inside by a stated method: SCALE toward
 *   the background (keeps the direction in every linear space),
 *   CHROMA_OKLCH or CHROMA_CIELCH (less chroma at the same lightness and
 *   hue), CHROMA_DKL (less of the isoluminant part, the luminance part
 *   kept), CLIP (per channel). A color in gamut comes back bit for bit.
 *   The bisections assume that the chroma in gamut at one lightness and
 *   hue is one interval from 0, true for every display tested.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CALIBRATION
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ycol_cal is the canonical form, in memory and on disk (62528 bytes,
 *   fixed offsets, little-endian, CRC-32). Fill it:
 *       ycol_cal_init(&c);
 *       ycol_cal_add(&c, YCOL_GUN_BLACK, 0, Y, x, y);     // all guns 0
 *       ycol_cal_add(&c, gun, level, Y, x, y);              // per gun, to 1
 *       ycol_cal_add(&c, YCOL_GUN_WHITE, 1, Y, x, y);     // additivity
 *       ycol_cal_set_spectra(&c, 380, 4, n, r, g, b, black); // optional
 *       ycol_cal_derive(&c, err, sizeof err);
 *   derive() linearizes each gun, Y' = (Y - Yblack) / (Y(1) - Yblack), by a
 *   monotone cubic (Fritsch and Carlson) inverted into the CLUT; refuses
 *   readings whose luminance does not rise, naming the level; gives RGB
 *   to XYZ (CIE 1931) from the full-level chromaticities, and RGB to LMS
 *   from the spectra with the Stockman and Sharpe (2000) 2-degree cone
 *   fundamentals (CVRL linss2_10e_1, embedded), the spectra interpolated
 *   linearly onto 1 nm. Black is removed from the matrices and kept apart
 *   (black_xyz, black_lms). derive() also seals the CRC. Any change after
 *   it (add(), set_spectra(), a field written by hand) leaves the CRC
 *   stale: call derive() again, or save(), which seals what is there. A
 *   context (and ysp/gfx.h's open) refuses a calibration that is not
 *   sealed.
 *   save() sets the CRC and copies the bytes; load() refuses another size,
 *   magic or version, a bad CRC, and a file whose stored matrices or CLUT
 *   differ from what its readings give: a calibration can always be
 *   rebuilt from its readings. ycol_cal_nominal() makes one from stated
 *   primaries and a gamma (an EDID's, sRGB's), flagged NOMINAL: not a
 *   measurement. ycol_cal_set_spectra_nominal() takes spectra from a
 *   datasheet and flags them SPECTRA_NOMINAL. Both flags appear in every
 *   describe line.
 *   The raw calls ycol_cal_lms(), _dir_cone(), _dkl_matrix(), _dir_dkl(),
 *   ycol_dkl_from_sph() and ycol_max_contrast() are ysp/gfx.h v0.3's,
 *   kept bit for bit for it. New code uses the context.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   OBSERVERS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   XYZ is always CIE 1931 2 degree, from the readings' chromaticities.
 *   Cones: desc.cones is SS2 (Stockman and Sharpe 2000, 2 degree, the CIE
 *   170-1:2006 fundamentals, CVRL linss2_10e_1; the default) or SS10 (the
 *   10 degree set, CVRL linss10e_1). The file stores the SS2 matrix; the
 *   context integrates SS10 from the stored spectra by the same loop.
 *   Standard luminance in cone units: 0.68990272 L + 0.34832189 M (2
 *   degree), 0.69283932 L + 0.34967567 M (10 degree). MacLeod-Boynton's s
 *   scale k puts the largest S / V on the spectrum locus at 1 (at 418 nm
 *   for both tables).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ISOLUMINANCE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   At the null of heterochromatic flicker photometry, minimum motion or
 *   a minimally distinct border, two lights a and b look equally luminous
 *   to the participant: w . (LMS(a) - LMS(b)) = 0, where w is the
 *   participant's luminance in cone units. ycol_lum keeps the raw
 *   settings (the two lights in linear device RGB, the calibration's CRC,
 *   the surround, repeats, SD, field size, eccentricity and frequency) and
 *   the weights that derive() fits from them:
 *       ycol_lum_init(&l, YCOL_CONES_SS2, YCOL_LUM_HFP);
 *       ycol_lum_pair(&cx, 0, elev, 0.1, a, b);   // a probe at an elevation
 *       ycol_lum_add(&l, a, b, bg, sd, n);        // the null the participant set
 *       ycol_lum_derive(&l, &cal, err, sizeof err);
 *   One setting fixes wL / wM with wS = 0; with YCOL_LUM_FIT_S, two
 *   independent settings fix wS too. The weights are scaled so that an
 *   equal-energy spectrum has the standard luminance. derive() refuses
 *   another calibration than the settings', no spectra, a = b, too few
 *   settings and a negative weight; resid[] is each setting's luminance
 *   contrast left. ycol_lum_stated() takes published weights (STATED).
 *   Give the record to the context (desc.lum). It sets the DKL luminance
 *   row, so the isoluminant plane is the participant's, and
 *   MacLeod-Boynton's l and luminance. It does not touch cone contrast,
 *   XYZ, CIELAB, CIELUV, Oklab or the D65 sources: those are CIE
 *   colorimetry. The file (.ysplum, 1688 bytes, CRC-32) keeps its settings,
 *   so ycol_lum_check() can fit the weights again.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   EXACTNESS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The math is double. The calibration stores float readings, spectra
 *   and CLUT; the matrices are double. Round trips through each space are
 *   within 1.4e-13 of the input (DKL spherical; 8.4e-15 for the rest,
 *   docs/color.md). Oklab's M2 is inverted exactly: Ottosson's printed
 *   10-digit inverse, which ysp/gfx.h's shader uses, is 2.4e-7 from it in
 *   linear RGB, inside the paint tolerance. C libraries differ by a few
 *   ulp in cbrt, sin, cos and atan2, so two platforms can differ in the
 *   last bits; the calibration itself uses none of them and gave the same
 *   bits on the three x64 compilers tested.
 *   ycol_output_code() repeats ysp/gfx.h's output stage in float (the
 *   CLUT interpolated, rounded at floor(v * max + 0.5), dither NONE) for
 *   a value the scene holds; an RGBA16F scene rounds a value first.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   COST
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ycol_ctx_init() checks the calibration's CRC (62 KB) and, for SS10,
 *   integrates 441 nm of spectra: a setup call. A conversion is a few
 *   3 x 3 products and, for the uniform spaces, cube roots or
 *   trigonometry: 5 to 75 ns a call (STATUS; examples/color/bench.c
 *   measures them on your machine).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   LEFT OUT
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ICC profiles, color appearance models (CIECAM02, CAM16), color
 *   difference formulas, reflectances and spectral rendering, named
 *   colors. The CIE 2006 age and field-size model (it needs lens and
 *   macular templates and a set of parameters per participant) and the
 *   Smith-Pokorny and Judd-Vos fundamentals (older work only): out of
 *   v0.1. The CIE 1964 10 degree XYZ (it needs spectra and its color
 *   matching functions). A cone space from XYZ alone (see MODEL).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Link libm on Linux. Define YCOL_API to override the default `extern`
 *   linkage; -DYCOL_API=static needs a translation unit that calls
 *   every function, or -Wno-unused-function.
