/* ysp/rt.h - v0.6.0 - public domain single-header real-time timing library
 *
 *   The clock, the waits, the scheduling ladder, the one-shot deadline
 *   worker, the background-compute pump, the event ring, the clock
 *   correlation, the device clock fit and the instrumentation macros that a
 *   psychophysics rig
 *   needs, factored out of the transport headers so experiment code and
 *   future transports share one clock base and one set of timing claims.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. It is
 *   the base the other ysp headers stand on: ysp/parallel.h and ysp/serial.h
 *   both include it and both run their trailing edges on the worker below.
 *
 *   Targets Windows, Linux and macOS, and WebAssembly through Emscripten
 *   (node, or a browser worker) with the scheduling ladder collapsed; see
 *   WEBASSEMBLY. C99 is the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and C++17, and in
 *   the C dialect MSVC compiles by default. Nothing but the OS.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.6.0 - The device clock fit: yrt_fit maps a device's own counter
 *          (a response box's ms timer, a board's micros(), a tracker's
 *          clock) to the ysp_rt clock from (ticks, host time) pairs. Three
 *          estimators: LATE (the lower envelope, for stamps that are late
 *          and never early), BRACKET (the least late of bracketed reads,
 *          wide brackets refused) and UNBIASED (least squares). Counter
 *          unwrap, a restart on a clock reset, a fixed window of 1024
 *          points, no allocation. With a ring it logs the thinned pairs
 *          (YRT_KIND_CLOCK) and each fit (YRT_KIND_FIT, new) for an
 *          offline refit. YRT_SRC_DEVICE (12) reserved for ysp/device.h.
 *          See DEVICE CLOCK FIT. Nothing else changed.
 *   v0.5.0 - The event ring: yrt_ring, a wait-free ring of 64-byte
 *          yrt_event records in memory the caller supplies, pushed from
 *          any number of threads (an audio callback included) and drained
 *          by one. A full ring refuses the new record, counts it, and the
 *          next drain reports the count in band as a YRT_KIND_LOSS
 *          record. See EVENT RING.
 *          yrt_correlate(): the ysp_rt clock against another clock read
 *          between two of its own reads, the tightest of N tries, with the
 *          bracket's width; an edge mode for coarse clocks.
 *          yrt_interrupt_time_100ns(), the Windows interrupt-time clock,
 *          and yrt_ticks_to_ns(), the exact conversion yrt_now_ns()
 *          applies to a QPC value. yrt_thread_id(). See CLOCK
 *          CORRELATION.
 *          The instrumentation macros (YRT_ZONE, YRT_FRAME_MARK,
 *          YRT_PLOT, YRT_MESSAGE and the rest): nothing by default, the
 *          Tracy C API with YRT_TRACY, records in a trace ring with
 *          YRT_TRACE_RING. The worker, the pump and yrt_sleep_until()
 *          are instrumented. See INSTRUMENTATION.
 *          YRT_OK, the YRT_ERR_* codes and yrt_strerror() are now
 *          outside the YRT_NO_THREADS guard, because the ring and the
 *          correlation use them; a no-threads build gains them and loses
 *          nothing. YRT_ERR_FULL's text is "ring full, not taken", for
 *          the pump and the event ring alike.
 *          Windows 11 power throttling: yrt_timer_resolution_begin() also
 *          opts the process out of the timer throttling a minimized process
 *          gets, and yrt_thread_elevate() and the pump thread opt their
 *          thread out of EcoQoS. yrt_report gains timer_throttle_off,
 *          ecoqos_off and throttle_known, and the yrt_describe() line ends
 *          in timer_throttle= and ecoqos= on every platform. See POWER
 *          THROTTLING under SCHEDULING.
 *          yrt_cpu_core_type() and yrt_core_type_name(): P-core or
 *          E-core, from Windows' EfficiencyClass. yrt_thread_elevate()
 *          prefers the P-cores on a hybrid CPU (Windows), and
 *          yrt_thread_pin() records what it pinned. yrt_report gains
 *          pinned_cpu, pinned_core and pcores_preferred, and the line
 *          gains pin= and cores=. A 256-byte buffer now always holds the
 *          line. See CORE TYPES under SCHEDULING.
 *   v0.4.1 - MinGW: the worker and pump threads start with the x87 control
 *          word of the thread that started them, not Windows' default, so
 *          x87 libm code (mingw-w64's msvcrt exp and pow) gives the same bits
 *          on the pump as on the main thread.
 *   v0.4.0 - An Emscripten branch, so the pump, the worker and the adaptive
 *          headers' async layers run in node and in a browser worker. It is
 *          the POSIX path with the Linux- and Mach-only calls taken out: the
 *          scheduling ladder collapses to YRT_POLICY_NORMAL, pinning,
 *          timer slack, memory locking and timer resolution report false,
 *          sleeps are the relative nanosleep loop, and
 *          yrt_get_clock_info() measures the clock's step instead of
 *          trusting Emscripten's clock_getres(). yrt_describe() adds
 *          "platform=wasm ladder=none" there and nowhere else. A worker or
 *          pump started in a module built without -pthread fails with a
 *          message naming the flag. No other platform changes behavior. See
 *          WEBASSEMBLY.
 *   v0.3.1 - yrt_pump_wait() is safe against a concurrent yrt_pump_stop()
 *          or yrt_pump_start() at ANY point, not only once it has parked.
 *          v0.3 checked for a live pump and then took its mutex, and a stop
 *          landing between the two destroyed the mutex under it; a binding
 *          had to slice its waits and defer its stop to cover that. A wait now
 *          registers in an atomic counter before it looks, a stop closes the
 *          door, releases every registered waiter and destroys nothing until
 *          the counter reads zero, and a restart never plain-writes the
 *          fields a racing wait reads. A wait racing a DRAINING stop now also
 *          waits for the drain, so a seq already in the queue returns 0
 *          instead of YRT_ERR_STOPPED. See STOP under PUMP.
 *          YRT_VERSION_MAJOR / _MINOR / _PATCH / _STRING and
 *          yrt_version(), so a binding reads its version from the header.
 *   v0.3 - yrt_pump, a background-compute worker: one thread, a fixed-size
 *          message ring, a callback per message in submit order, an idle
 *          callback for spare work, a "done through seq" the frame loop polls
 *          or waits on, and a lock the caller shares with the callbacks. It is
 *          the opposite end of yrt_worker: that one runs a short job AT a
 *          deadline at the top of the scheduling ladder, this one runs a long
 *          job BETWEEN deadlines at or below normal priority. See PUMP.
 *          Two new return codes, YRT_ERR_FULL and YRT_ERR_TIMEOUT, and a
 *          new bottom rung YRT_POLICY_BELOW_NORMAL, appended to
 *          yrt_policy so every existing value keeps its number. Only the
 *          pump ever returns it; yrt_thread_elevate() never lowers.
 *          yrt_strerror() names both new codes, and the YRT_ERR_STOPPED
 *          text now says "worker or pump" because both use it.
 *          The worker is unchanged.
 *   v0.2 - yrt_worker_desc.on_start, a hook that runs ON THE WORKER THREAD
 *          after elevation and before yrt_worker_start() publishes
 *          readiness, and fails the start when it returns false. The
 *          parallel port's DIRECT backend needs exactly that: Linux grants
 *          port I/O permission per THREAD, so the grant has to happen on the
 *          worker and a refusal has to fail ypar_open() rather than surface
 *          one trial later.
 *          yrt_job_info.seq and yrt_worker_pending(). Every submit
 *          stamps the job with a sequence number and RETURNS it, so a job
 *          can tell whether it is still the one a caller is waiting for.
 *          yrt_worker_submit() therefore returns a positive seq on success
 *          instead of YRT_OK; failures are still negative YRT_ERR_*, so
 *          the test is `rc < 0`, not `rc != YRT_OK`.
 *          The Linux feature-test macro is now _DEFAULT_SOURCE, and it is
 *          set on the FIRST include of this header rather than only in an
 *          implementation translation unit. Including ysp/rt.h before a
 *          transport header no longer hides what that transport needs
 *          (CRTSCTS, realpath) behind strict POSIX.
 *          The compile-time assertions fall back to a negative-array-size
 *          typedef, and _Alignof to a struct offset, before C11. MSVC's
 *          default C dialect, which is what setuptools and mex compile with,
 *          now builds this header without /std:c11.
 *   v0.1 - first release.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.6.0. The device clock fit (v0.6.0) is built with warnings
 *   as errors by MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX, C11 and C++17), MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1
 *   (C99, C11, C++17) and gcc 11.4 on WSL2 (C99, C++17), and its tests in
 *   tests/adapt/rt_test_fit.h pass on all three, also under ASan and
 *   UBSan on WSL2. They run seeded synthetic devices against the true line
 *   (computed in long double) and against a brute-force envelope and the
 *   closed form of least squares (both within 2 ns). Map minus truth at
 *   each new pair's tick, over four seed sets, from 10 s on and (in
 *   brackets) from 205 s on, when the window is full: LATE, a ms timer at
 *   100 pairs a second behind a 1 ms USB frame, an exponential tail, 16 ms
 *   bursts and 60 to 200 ms stalls, -75 to +240 us (-47 to +91); LATE, a
 *   us counter that wraps, -12 to +46 us (-5 to +18); BRACKET, 0.4 to 3 ms
 *   brackets every 100 ms, -327 to +628 us (-42 to +110); UNBIASED, SD
 *   115 us, -23 to +22 us (-5 to +7); LATE, a press every 2 to 4 s behind a
 *   16 ms latency timer, up to +8.7 ms at 2 min and -1.4 to +3.2 ms from
 *   205 s. Before the slope (the first 5 s), a 500 ppm clock: -541 to +160
 *   us at the pair, -641 to +60 us 200 ms ahead. Rates within 0.9 ppm of
 *   the truth at the end of each run. A counter reset gives
 *   one restart 1.0 to 1.3 s later; a 300 ms stall gives none. With a full
 *   window a pair costs 0.1 us at p99 without a refit, and a refit 9 to 23
 *   us at p50 (up to 50 us max; one per 200 ms bucket), measured with gcc
 *   and MSVC on the laptop below. 17 of 17 mutants are caught
 *   (tests/mutate/rt.toml). No device has fed it: every number here is
 *   synthetic.
 *   v0.5.0's event ring, the correlation and the macros (v0.5.0)
 *   are built with warnings as errors by MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX, its default C
 *   dialect, /std:c11 and /std:c++17), by MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 (C99, C11,
 *   C++17) on Windows 11, and by gcc 11.4 on WSL2 (C99, C11, C++17), in all
 *   three macro modes; also by MSVC for 32-bit x86, and by emcc 6.0.10 (C11
 *   and C++17, with and without -pthread, with YRT_NO_THREADS and with
 *   YRT_TRACE_RING). YRT_TRACY is built and run against Tracy v0.14.1
 *   by MSVC and gcc. tests/adapt/rt_test.c, which runs in
 *   YRT_TRACE_RING mode, passes on all of them (under node with -pthread)
 *   and is clean under ThreadSanitizer and ASan+UBSan on Linux. It checks open and sizing, order, seq, the stamps,
 *   a full ring and its LOSS record, and a stress run of 2, 4 and 8
 *   producers pushing 20,000 records each into 256 slots against one
 *   drainer, where every record carries words derived from (producer,
 *   index): no torn record, no duplicate, per-producer order, no seq gap,
 *   and drained + refused equal to pushed exactly, with the LOSS records
 *   adding up to the refusals. Three deliberately broken copies of the
 *   header are caught by it: publishing before the copy (every run, and
 *   by TSan), no admission check (every run), and freeing the slots before
 *   copying them out (2 runs of 3). The trace test checks every macro and
 *   the zone and thread name the worker emits; the correlation test checks
 *   a known offset, a 1 ms clock's edge within half the width, the
 *   timeout, and on Windows that interrupt time runs at the QPC rate and
 *   that yrt_ticks_to_ns() brackets yrt_now_ns() and matches a 128-bit
 *   reference. examples/rt_ring_bench.c measured, on a 16-thread Windows 11
 *   machine (MSVC and MinGW) and in WSL2 on the same machine (8 vCPUs),
 *   per push: 11 to 16 ns from one thread with the stamps set (14 to 37 ns
 *   in WSL2) and 37 to 43 ns with t_ns and tid stamped by the ring; 0.4 to
 *   0.6 us mean with 8 threads pushing back-to-back on Windows (1.5 us in
 *   WSL2, where 9 threads share 8 vCPUs). A TIME_CRITICAL producer pushing
 *   once a millisecond while 7 others hammered took 1.5 to 2.2 us at the
 *   99.9th percentile, clock reads included, against 115 to 553 us for the
 *   same records behind a lock. Drain: 1.5 to 6 ns per record. A zone in
 *   YRT_TRACE_RING mode costs 52 to 95 ns with a ring attached and under
 *   1 ns over an empty loop without one (471 ns attached under node, where
 *   one clock read costs 190 ns); the default mode is the empty
 *   loop; Tracy v0.14.1 costs 2 to 10 ns per zone on demand and not
 *   connected, 65 to 90 ns buffering. Correlation: a 100 ns width (one QPC
 *   tick, the floor) against QPC and interrupt time on Windows and 41 to
 *   46 ns against CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW in WSL2, 1 to 2 us per call; an edge
 *   of GetTickCount64 to 100 to 200 ns, in 62 ms for 4 edges. The
 *   head-of-line stall in EVENT RING is real: with producers at 1.1 million
 *   records a second, drains waited up to 5 ms on a producer descheduled
 *   inside its push, and the elevated producer's pushes were refused (up
 *   to 684 of 5000); with a stall injected at 6000 records a second the
 *   refusals began between 0.6 and 0.8 s, as 4096 / 6000 predicts. As root
 *   under WSL2 the bench's worker obtained YRT_POLICY_DEADLINE. The
 *   tables are in docs/rt.md.
 *   POWER THROTTLING was measured on an i7-1360P laptop (4 P-cores, 8
 *   E-cores) under Windows 11 25H2 build 26200, on AC power, by a probe
 *   that owns a window, visible, minimized and covered by a second
 *   process's window, with 12 s to settle. Minimized, timeBeginPeriod(1)
 *   waits of 1 and 2 ms woke 13 to 14 ms late (3 of 3 runs); with the
 *   IGNORE_TIMER_RESOLUTION opt-out, 0.44 to 0.76 ms. The high-resolution
 *   timer that yrt_sleep_until(), the worker and the pump use woke 0.26 to
 *   0.46 ms late (p50) in every state, with or without either opt-out.
 *   Minimized, 99 to 100% of the threads ran on E-cores; one computation
 *   alternated on one thread took 1.12 to 1.22 ms opted out of EcoQoS
 *   against 1.42 to 1.60 ms not (2 runs), and 7 to 12% less while visible.
 *   SetProcessInformation and SetThreadInformation returned success for
 *   every mask, also in a 32-bit process, where GetThreadInformation cannot
 *   read the state back (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER) and the report uses what
 *   this header set. CORE TYPES was measured on the same laptop with 8
 *   spinning threads of a second process loading all cores, alternating
 *   the setting every 200 ms on the same threads for 30 s, two runs each
 *   visible and minimized. With the EcoQoS opt-out alone, the elevated
 *   frame thread and the worker ran on E-cores 55 to 90% of the time;
 *   steered to every P-core CPU set, 0%, their fixed computation was 9 to
 *   25% faster at p50, and their wake p99 was lower in 7 of 8 pairs (by 3
 *   to 15%, and 9% higher in the eighth). Splitting the P-cores so the two
 *   elevated threads never share a physical core measured the same as
 *   steering both to all of them. The pump, steered, was 8 to 20% faster
 *   but its wake p99 was 14.5 ms in 1 run of 4 against 0.14 ms. Without
 *   the load every thread already ran on P-cores 92 to 100% of the time.
 *   Covering the window throttled the timer in 1 of 19 runs
 *   only, and battery power was not available to test.
 *   The Windows path is built and measured on Windows 11 by
 *   examples/rt_jitter.c, and also builds in MSVC's default (pre-C11) C mode,
 *   which is what the Python and MEX bindings compile with. The Linux path is
 *   built as C11, as C++17 and with YRT_NO_THREADS (warnings as errors) and
 *   run under a WSL2 kernel, including a ThreadSanitizer run of the worker's
 *   submit, replace, cancel, flush, seq and on_start paths. The macOS path
 *   has not been compiled or run at all; CI compiles it.
 *   The pump is built and run on Windows 11 (MSVC /W4 /WX) and on the same
 *   WSL2 kernel as C11, C99 and C++17, clean under ThreadSanitizer and under
 *   AddressSanitizer with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, by
 *   tests/adapt/rt_test.c (order, seq, done_seq, wait, ERR_FULL,
 *   on_idle, drain, drop, the publish lock over a few thousand messages, the
 *   inline and the caller-supplied ring, on_start refusal, a stop releasing a
 *   blocked wait, a zeroed handle, a double stop, a submit after stop) and by
 *   examples/rt_pump.c. The v0.3.1 wait-versus-stop guarantee is checked by a
 *   hammer in the same test (two threads in a loop of 0.3 ms waits while the
 *   main thread stops and restarts the pump 300 times, idle, draining and
 *   dropping), clean under ThreadSanitizer on Linux and run on Windows; a
 *   copy of the header whose stop skips the waiter drain is caught by the
 *   same TSan run, so the clean result is not an instrumentation accident.
 *   Both platforms returned YRT_POLICY_BELOW_NORMAL, and on Linux the nice
 *   value moved on the pump thread only (+5) with the calling thread's left
 *   alone, which is what the per-thread claim in PUMP rests on.
 *   The Emscripten path is built with emcc 6.0.10 as C11 and C++17 with
 *   warnings as errors, with -pthread, without it and with YRT_NO_THREADS,
 *   and run under node 24 with -pthread -sPROXY_TO_PTHREAD=1: the whole of
 *   tests/adapt/rt_test.c passes there, wait-versus-stop hammer
 *   included, as do examples/rt_jitter.c, examples/rt_pump.c, and the
 *   QUEST+ and GP test suites with their async layers on. Under node the
 *   clock claims 1 ns and shows a smallest step of 0.26 us on a pthread and
 *   0.48 us on the main thread, where one read costs 0.6 us and 3.4 us. Over
 *   five rt_jitter runs of 2 ms waits on a pthread, on a loaded development
 *   machine running node inside Docker, the median wake was 118 to 251 us
 *   late with no spin window, 0.1 to 47 us with the default 200 us, and
 *   0.1 us with 1 ms; the p99 ranged from 0.1 ms to 20 ms and belongs to the
 *   host, not to wasm. Measure on the machine you will use.
 *   No browser has run any of it: the WEBASSEMBLY notes on the main thread,
 *   cross-origin isolation and coarsened clocks are the platform's
 *   documented rules, not measurements.
 *   The macOS pump, like the rest of the macOS path, has not been compiled or
 *   run here at all, so its relative condition wait and its
 *   THREAD_PRECEDENCE_POLICY rung are written, not tested; CI compiles them and
 *   a rig should print what yrt_pump_policy() reports before believing it.
 *   The top of the ladder is barely exercised: the test hosts run without
 *   CAP_SYS_NICE, so the tests see YRT_POLICY_TIME_CRITICAL (Windows) and
 *   YRT_POLICY_NORMAL. YRT_POLICY_DEADLINE was obtained once, by
 *   rt_ring_bench run as root under WSL2 (v0.5.0), and nothing timed there
 *   is a claim about a real kernel; YRT_POLICY_FIFO and
 *   YRT_POLICY_TIME_CONSTRAINT have never been obtained. Treat the
 *   real-time rungs as written, not as tested, and check what
 *   yrt_describe() reports on your rig.
 *   Outside this STATUS block, no number in this header is a measurement.
 *   Every latency statement is a bound or a pointer at rt_jitter.

 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_RT_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header to create the
 *   implementation. Every other file just includes the header normally.
 *
 *       #define YSP_RT_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       #include "ysp/rt.h"
 *
 *       yrt_policy pol = yrt_thread_elevate(NULL);   // NULL = defaults
 *       yrt_report rep;
 *       char line[192];
 *       yrt_report_get(&rep, pol);
 *       yrt_describe(&rep, line, sizeof line);
 *       puts(line);                      // log this next to your timings
 *
 *       uint64_t t = yrt_now_ns();
 *       for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
 *           t += 10000000ull;                       // a 10 ms frame
 *           uint64_t late = yrt_sleep_until(t, YRT_DEFAULT_SPIN_NS);
 *           do_frame(i, late);
 *       }
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CLOCK
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yrt_now_ns() and yrt_now_us() read a monotonic clock:
 *   CLOCK_MONOTONIC on Linux and macOS, QueryPerformanceCounter on Windows,
 *   converted with integer arithmetic split so that a TSC-rate counter
 *   cannot overflow the multiply. The clock never steps and never goes
 *   backwards; its zero is arbitrary, so only differences mean anything.
 *
 *   This is the SAME clock base as ysp/serial.h's yser_now_us() and the same
 *   base ysp/parallel.h times its pulses against, on every platform the two
 *   share. A timestamp from yrt_now_us() and one from yser_now_us() taken
 *   in the same process are directly comparable; subtract them. They are not
 *   comparable across a reboot or with wall-clock time.
 *
 *   yrt_ticks_to_ns() is the conversion yrt_now_ns() applies to the raw
 *   counter, as a function. On Windows, give it a QueryPerformanceCounter
 *   value that another API reports (DXGI's SyncQPCTime, a WASAPI QPC
 *   position). The result is the ysp_rt time of that counter value, bit for
 *   bit, so you do not need a correlation for it. On the other platforms
 *   the counter already counts nanoseconds and the function returns its
 *   argument.
 *
 *   yrt_get_clock_info() reports what the OS says the clock is worth
 *   (clock_getres on POSIX, 1 s / QueryPerformanceFrequency on Windows) and
 *   whether a Windows high-resolution waitable timer could be created. The
 *   resolution is the tick the clock counts in, not the cost of reading it
 *   and not the accuracy of any wait.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   WAITS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yrt_sleep_until(deadline_ns, spin_ns) is the workhorse. It hands the
 *   bulk of the wait to the OS, wakes spin_ns before the deadline, then
 *   spins on the clock to the deadline itself, and returns how late it
 *   actually woke in nanoseconds. Log that number; it is the only honest
 *   statement this header can make about its own accuracy on your machine.
 *
 *     Linux:   clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME). Absolute, so
 *              a signal restart cannot add the elapsed time back on. Its
 *              accuracy is bounded below by the thread's timer slack (50 us
 *              by default; see yrt_thread_set_timer_slack) and above by
 *              whatever else the scheduler is doing.
 *     macOS:   no absolute clock_nanosleep exists, so the wait is a relative
 *              nanosleep recomputed from the clock on each iteration. A
 *              short wake does not shorten the total.
 *     Windows: a waitable timer created with
 *              CREATE_WAITABLE_TIMER_HIGH_RESOLUTION (Win10 1803+). If that
 *              is refused, the fallback timer only fires on the system tick,
 *              about 15.6 ms, and the spin window is WIDENED to a full tick
 *              so the deadline is still met, trading CPU for accuracy
 *              exactly as ysp/parallel.h does. That widening is the only
 *              time this function ignores your spin_ns.
 *
 *   spin_ns = 0 leaves the entire wait to the OS. On Windows even the
 *   high-resolution timer may fire up to about a millisecond late; on Linux
 *   the floor is the thread's timer slack. A spin window buys accuracy with a
 *   busy core: the thread burns CPU for spin_ns of every wait. Pick it from
 *   measurement, not from this comment, and run examples/rt_jitter.c on the
 *   rig to see what each window is worth there.
 *
 *   yrt_spin_until() is the pure-spin floor: no syscall, a pause
 *   instruction in the loop so a sibling hyperthread is not starved. It is
 *   as accurate as the clock and as expensive as a full core.
 *
 *   yrt_sleep_ns() is the relative convenience wrapper. It, and a zeroed
 *   yrt_worker_desc.spin_ns, take YRT_DEFAULT_SPIN_NS as the window. That
 *   default is NOT the same on every platform, because the OS wait it has to
 *   cover is not the same:
 *
 *     Windows: about 1.2 ms, because the high-resolution waitable timer may
 *              fire that late. A narrower window leaves a median lateness the
 *              OS wait itself cannot remove, so the spin is the only thing
 *              that closes it. ysp/parallel.h spins the last ~1.14 ms of a
 *              pulse for the same reason.
 *     Linux,
 *     macOS:   200 us, which covers the default 50 us timer slack and the
 *              ordinary scheduling delay behind it. A wider window here would
 *              burn CPU for nothing.
 *
 *   Both are starting points, not measurements, and a rig with a different
 *   power plan, chipset or background load will want a different number.
 *   examples/rt_jitter.c sweeps several windows, marks this platform's
 *   default, and prints the wake latency distribution of each: pick yours
 *   from that output and pass it to yrt_sleep_until() or to
 *   yrt_worker_desc.spin_ns.
 *
 *   No wait in this header allocates. On Windows each thread that calls
 *   yrt_sleep_until() creates one waitable timer on first use and reuses
 *   it; yrt_thread_cleanup() releases it for a thread that is about to
 *   end and will not wait again.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SCHEDULING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yrt_thread_elevate() raises the CALLING thread as far up this ladder
 *   as the OS and this process's privileges allow, and reports the rung that
 *   stuck. Asking is not getting: every rung can be refused, nothing fails,
 *   and the return value is the only way to know what you have.
 *
 *     YRT_POLICY_DEADLINE         Linux SCHED_DEADLINE, through the raw
 *                                   sched_setattr syscall (glibc has no
 *                                   wrapper). Needs CAP_SYS_NICE, and the
 *                                   kernel also refuses it when the thread's
 *                                   affinity is not the full root domain,
 *                                   which is why yrt_thread_pin() and this
 *                                   rung are mutually exclusive.
 *     YRT_POLICY_TIME_CONSTRAINT  macOS THREAD_TIME_CONSTRAINT_POLICY via
 *                                   thread_policy_set: the same "runtime in
 *                                   a period by a deadline" reservation,
 *                                   under a different kernel. Its own rung
 *                                   because it is neither SCHED_DEADLINE nor
 *                                   SCHED_FIFO and should not be logged as
 *                                   either.
 *     YRT_POLICY_FIFO             SCHED_FIFO at priority 80, or the system
 *                                   maximum when that is lower. 80 is above
 *                                   the kernel's threaded IRQ handlers (50)
 *                                   and below migration and the watchdog
 *                                   (99). Needs CAP_SYS_NICE on Linux.
 *     YRT_POLICY_TIME_CRITICAL    Windows THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL.
 *                                   On every rung it gets, the Windows
 *                                   thread is also opted out of EcoQoS; see
 *                                   POWER THROTTLING below.
 *     YRT_POLICY_NORMAL           Nothing was granted. On Linux the timer
 *                                   slack is still dropped to 1 ns (the kernel
 *                                   rounds up to its own floor), which is free
 *                                   and removes 50 us of deliberate lateness
 *                                   from every wait.
 *
 *   One rung sits BELOW that floor and is not part of this ladder:
 *   YRT_POLICY_BELOW_NORMAL, which only yrt_pump asks for and only when
 *   yrt_pump_desc.below_normal is set. yrt_thread_elevate() never lowers a
 *   thread, and nothing here ever moves a thread down the ladder it climbed.
 *
 *   The reservation (yrt_sched_deadline: runtime, deadline, period in ns)
 *   means the same thing here as in ypar_desc.sched and yser_desc.sched:
 *   runtime is the CPU budget guaranteed and capped per period, the relative
 *   deadline orders EDF priority, and runtime/period is the bandwidth the
 *   kernel must admit. All-zero means the library defaults, 1 ms in 10 ms.
 *   yrt_sched_normalize() applies the same validation the transport
 *   headers apply at open time: a zero period becomes the deadline, and
 *   0 < runtime <= deadline <= period must hold.
 *
 *   The rest of the setup calls each do one thing and say whether it took:
 *
 *     yrt_thread_set_timer_slack()  Linux PR_SET_TIMERSLACK. A normal
 *                                     thread's timers are allowed to fire
 *                                     50 us late so the kernel can batch
 *                                     wakeups. Set it to 1 ns (rounded up to
 *                                     the kernel's floor) and that deliberate
 *                                     lateness is gone. No-op elsewhere.
 *     yrt_thread_pin()              Bind the calling thread to one CPU.
 *                                     PINNING DEFEATS SCHED_DEADLINE: the
 *                                     kernel's admission test refuses a
 *                                     deadline task whose affinity is not
 *                                     the root domain, so pin OR take the
 *                                     DEADLINE rung, not both. Pinning plus
 *                                     an isolated core (isolcpus, nohz_full)
 *                                     is the other way to build a quiet
 *                                     thread. macOS has no true pinning, only
 *                                     an affinity hint, so this returns false
 *                                     there. On a hybrid CPU the number does
 *                                     not tell you the kind of core: ask
 *                                     yrt_cpu_core_type() first, and read
 *                                     pin= in the report line. See CORE
 *                                     TYPES.
 *     yrt_process_lock_memory()     POSIX mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE):
 *                                     no page of this process is paged out,
 *                                     so no wait ends in a major fault. Needs
 *                                     RLIMIT_MEMLOCK headroom or CAP_IPC_LOCK.
 *                                     WINDOWS HAS NO EQUIVALENT. VirtualLock
 *                                     and SetProcessWorkingSetSize pin
 *                                     individual pages into a working set
 *                                     whose size the memory manager still
 *                                     owns; neither is mlockall. This
 *                                     function does nothing and returns false
 *                                     on Windows rather than claim otherwise.
 *     yrt_timer_resolution_begin()  Windows timeBeginPeriod(1), loaded from
 *                                     winmm at runtime so the header keeps
 *                                     its "no libraries" promise. It lowers
 *                                     the system tick so ordinary waits get
 *                                     finer. Since Windows 10 2004 the effect
 *                                     is per-process, not global, so it no
 *                                     longer slows the whole machine down and
 *                                     no longer helps another process. The
 *                                     high-resolution waitable timer that
 *                                     yrt_sleep_until() uses makes it
 *                                     largely unnecessary; it still matters
 *                                     for Sleep() and for the fallback timer.
 *                                     It also opts the process out of the
 *                                     Windows 11 timer throttling below.
 *                                     Pair with yrt_timer_resolution_end().
 *                                     No-op elsewhere.
 *
 *   POWER THROTTLING (Windows 11). When every window of a process is
 *   minimized or hidden, Windows may do two things to it:
 *
 *     Timer resolution  It no longer honors timeBeginPeriod(). Sleep() and
 *                       a waitable timer without the high-resolution flag
 *                       wake on the 15.6 ms tick again. Measured on this
 *                       repository's test laptop, minimized: 13 ms late
 *                       instead of 0.5 ms. yrt_timer_resolution_begin()
 *                       therefore also calls SetProcessInformation() with
 *                       PROCESS_POWER_THROTTLING_IGNORE_TIMER_RESOLUTION,
 *                       which kept the 0.5 ms. yrt_sleep_until(), the
 *                       worker and the pump use the high-resolution timer,
 *                       which this throttling does not touch: no state
 *                       changed their lateness.
 *     EcoQoS            It runs the process's threads on efficiency cores.
 *                       Minimized, 99 to 100% of the measured threads ran on
 *                       E-cores, and the same computation took about 1.25
 *                       times as long; wake lateness did not change. So
 *                       yrt_thread_elevate() and the pump thread call
 *                       SetThreadInformation() with
 *                       THREAD_POWER_THROTTLING_EXECUTION_SPEED off, for the
 *                       calling thread only. A worker with no_elevate and
 *                       every thread ysp/rt.h does not touch are left to the
 *                       OS.
 *
 *   Both calls are looked up at run time, so the header still builds and
 *   runs on Windows versions and with MinGW headers that lack them; there a
 *   call does nothing, and the report says n/a. Neither call is undone: the
 *   opt-outs last for the life of the process and the thread.
 *   yrt_timer_resolution_end() does not undo the first one.
 *
 *   CORE TYPES. A hybrid CPU has performance cores (P) and efficiency cores
 *   (E). yrt_cpu_core_type(cpu) says which one a logical CPU is. On
 *   Windows 10 and later it reads the EfficiencyClass of
 *   GetSystemCpuSetInformation(): the highest class is P, any lower class
 *   is E, one class everywhere is YRT_CORE_UNIFORM. Everywhere else it
 *   returns YRT_CORE_UNKNOWN. Linux on Intel hybrid lists the two kinds
 *   in /sys/devices/cpu_core/cpus and /sys/devices/cpu_atom/cpus, but WSL2
 *   hides them (it shows 8 identical vCPUs on the test laptop's 4 P-cores
 *   and 8 E-cores), so this header does not read them; check those files
 *   yourself before you pin on a Linux rig.
 *
 *   On Windows, yrt_thread_elevate() also prefers the P-cores for the
 *   calling thread, with SetThreadSelectedCpuSets() and the CPU sets of the
 *   highest EfficiencyClass. It does this on a hybrid CPU only. The opt-out
 *   from EcoQoS alone does not keep a thread on a P-core: with 8 busy
 *   threads on the test laptop, an elevated thread still woke on an E-core
 *   55 to 90% of the time, and a fixed computation took 9 to 25% longer
 *   than on a P-core. With the preference it ran on P-cores every time.
 *   The preference is soft: Windows still runs the thread elsewhere when
 *   no P-core is available. yrt_thread_pin() removes it, because a pin
 *   is the explicit choice. The pump does not get it: at normal priority on
 *   busy P-cores, its wake p99 rose to 14.5 ms in one run of four. Every
 *   thread ysp/rt.h does not touch is left alone.
 *
 *   yrt_report_get() and yrt_describe() put the whole outcome on one
 *   line, for the log file next to the timing data:
 *
 *     ysp_rt: policy=TIME_CRITICAL clock_res=100ns slack=n/a hires_timer=yes
 *             mlock=no timer_res=yes timer_throttle=off ecoqos=off pin=none
 *             cores=P
 *
 *   timer_throttle=off means the process is opted out of the timer
 *   throttling, and ecoqos=off that the CALLING thread is opted out of
 *   EcoQoS; "on" means Windows may still apply it, and "n/a" means the OS
 *   has no such setting (every platform but Windows 10 1709 and later).
 *   pin= is the CPU yrt_thread_pin() bound the calling thread to, with
 *   its kind (P, E, uniform or ?), or none. cores=P means the calling
 *   thread prefers the P-cores; cores=any means it does not.
 *
 *   Jitter numbers without that line are unlabeled. Print it.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   WORKER
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yrt_worker is one thread that runs one callback at one absolute
 *   deadline. The caller allocates the handle, yrt_worker_start() spawns
 *   the thread, and the thread elevates ITSELF up the ladder above and
 *   publishes the rung it got before start() returns, so the policy is known
 *   before the first trial and no trial pays for thread creation.
 *
 *     yrt_worker_submit(w, deadline_ns, fn, ctx)
 *         One pending job per worker. A submit while a job is pending
 *         REPLACES it, earlier deadline or later, and the worker re-evaluates
 *         at once. There is no queue: a rig that needs two independent
 *         deadlines starts two workers.
 *     yrt_worker_cancel(w)
 *         Drops the pending job.
 *     yrt_worker_stop(w)
 *         Runs a pending job IMMEDIATELY (a flush, with info->flushed set)
 *         and then joins. This is what the transport headers do when they
 *         close with a pulse in flight: a trailing edge that never lands is
 *         worse than an early one.
 *
 *   The callback runs ON THE WORKER THREAD, at the worker's policy, WITHOUT
 *   the worker's lock held. That is deliberate and it is what makes the
 *   callback usable: it may call yrt_worker_submit() on its own worker to
 *   re-arm a periodic job, it may block, and it cannot deadlock against a
 *   submit from another thread. The price is that a callback which outlives
 *   its own deadline overlaps the next one, and that two calls to a
 *   non-reentrant routine from the callback and from the main thread need
 *   the caller's own lock. Nothing in the callback's data is protected by
 *   ysp/rt.h.
 *
 *   Nothing allocates after yrt_worker_start() returns. The handle carries
 *   its own OS objects, the job is three fields, and submit, cancel and the
 *   worker's own wait are all allocation-free.
 *
 *   A submit or cancel issued inside the worker's final spin window is seen
 *   AFTER the spin ends, not during: the worker releases its lock to spin, so
 *   the call does not block, but the job it was racing has already been
 *   chosen. The race is exactly as wide as the worker's spin window, so it is
 *   wider on Windows than on Linux and macOS when the desc leaves that window
 *   at YRT_DEFAULT_SPIN_NS. See WAITS.
 *
 *   yrt_worker_desc.on_start runs ON THE WORKER THREAD, after the thread
 *   elevates itself and before yrt_worker_start() returns, and a false
 *   return fails the start. It is for state the OS keeps PER THREAD, which
 *   the thread that calls start() cannot set up on the worker's behalf: the
 *   parallel port's DIRECT backend grants itself ioperm()/iopl() there,
 *   because those are per-thread on Linux and a refused grant has to fail
 *   the open, not the first trigger.
 *
 *   Every submit stamps the job with a sequence number, returns it, and
 *   hands the same number to the callback as yrt_job_info.seq;
 *   yrt_worker_pending() reports the seq of the job now pending, or 0. A
 *   job that has to know whether it is still the one its caller is waiting
 *   for can compare the two, without a token of its own. The numbers are
 *   positive, increasing and unique per worker; nothing else about them is
 *   promised.
 *
 *   Both transport headers build their trailing edges on this worker, and
 *   both keep a small mutex and a token of their own beside it. That is not
 *   duplication: the worker runs the callback with ITS lock released (see
 *   above), so serializing the register or the byte stream is the
 *   transport's job, and a job already inside its final spin window cannot
 *   be canceled, so "a plain write cancels a pending trailing edge" needs a
 *   token the callback rechecks under the transport's own lock. See the
 *   THREADING section of ysp/serial.h and the async block of ysp/parallel.h
 *   for each one. Everything ELSE uses this worker as it stands: a stimulus
 *   onset, a frame boundary, a response window, a new transport you write.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PUMP
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yrt_pump is the other half of the worker's job, and the opposite shape.
 *   The worker runs a SHORT callback AT a deadline, as high up the scheduling
 *   ladder as it can get. The pump runs a LONG callback BETWEEN deadlines, at
 *   normal priority or below it, and never climbs.
 *
 *   What it is for: an adaptive method whose inference does not fit a frame.
 *   A QUEST+ selection over a large grid, a Gaussian-process refit, a
 *   hyperparameter fit; see docs/adapt.md, "Inference on a thread". The
 *   trial loop submits the response and returns to drawing; the pump runs
 *   update and next; the loop asks "is the next stimulus ready?" when the
 *   inter-trial interval ends. That turns a frame budget from a hard
 *   constraint into a contract the code can check, and it makes background
 *   fitting free: on_idle runs one fit step whenever nothing is queued.
 *
 *       yrt_pump_desc d = {          // unset fields are 0: the defaults
 *           .msg_size = sizeof(trial_result),
 *           .capacity = 8,
 *           .on_msg   = infer,         // runs on the pump thread
 *           .on_idle  = fit_one_step,  // optional; true = call me again
 *           .ctx      = &model,
 *       };
 *       if (!yrt_pump_start(&pump, &d)) die(yrt_pump_error(&pump));
 *
 *       int seq = yrt_pump_submit(&pump, &result);   // < 0 is an error
 *       ...                                           // draw some frames
 *       if (yrt_pump_done_seq(&pump) >= (uint32_t)seq) {
 *           yrt_pump_lock(&pump);                   // read the publication
 *           next_level = model.published_level;
 *           yrt_pump_unlock(&pump);
 *       }
 *
 *   THE RING. msg_size bytes times capacity messages, either a buffer the
 *   caller owns or, when desc.ring is NULL, an inline buffer inside the
 *   handle (YRT_PUMP_INLINE_BYTES, 4096 by default). Nothing allocates,
 *   ever. yrt_pump_submit() COPIES the message into the ring and returns its
 *   sequence number; when the ring is full it returns YRT_ERR_FULL and
 *   copies nothing, so the caller still owns the message it tried to send and
 *   may retry it on the next frame. That is the honest failure: a pump that
 *   silently grew a queue would trade a visible error for an invisible
 *   unbounded latency. A message being handled still occupies its slot until
 *   on_msg returns, because on_msg reads it in place; so a full ring means
 *   capacity messages accepted and at most one of them in flight.
 *
 *   Submit is safe from several threads at once: it takes the ring's mutex.
 *   The ring has exactly ONE consumer, the pump thread, and on_msg is called
 *   for each message in submit order, one at a time, never concurrently with
 *   itself and never with either lock held. The order across two threads that
 *   submit at the same instant is the order the mutex granted them, which is
 *   the only order there is to have.
 *
 *   DONE_SEQ AND WAIT. yrt_pump_done_seq() is the highest seq whose on_msg
 *   has RETURNED. It is one atomic load, no lock, cheap enough for a frame
 *   loop to poll every frame. It is published after the callback returns, so
 *   `done_seq >= seq` means the work for that message is finished and whatever
 *   it published is readable. yrt_pump_wait() is the blocking form with a
 *   relative timeout, for the end of an inter-trial interval: it returns 0
 *   when the pump has passed the seq and YRT_ERR_TIMEOUT when the timeout
 *   ran out first. Poll in a frame loop; wait in an interval you are willing
 *   to lengthen.
 *
 *   THE LOCK. yrt_pump_lock() / yrt_pump_unlock() guard a struct the
 *   callbacks write and the caller reads: the proposal, a posterior summary,
 *   a progress counter. It is a SEPARATE mutex from the ring's, and that is
 *   the whole point. on_msg runs without it held and is expected to take it
 *   only around its publish, at the end, for the few instructions a struct
 *   copy costs. So a caller may hold it for as long as it likes without
 *   stalling the pump's inference, the ring, a submit, or a done_seq poll; the
 *   only thing that waits is a publish. Nothing else in the pump takes it, and
 *   the pump never reads what you put under it.
 *
 *   IDLE. on_idle runs on the pump thread, with no lock held, whenever the
 *   ring is empty. Return true and it is called again (after a re-check of the
 *   ring, so a submit is never starved by a busy idle callback); return false,
 *   or leave on_idle NULL, and the thread blocks on a condition variable until
 *   the next submit or the stop. It must return promptly, a few milliseconds:
 *   a stop cannot join the thread until it does, and a message cannot be
 *   dispatched until it does. One gradient step, not a whole fit.
 *
 *   PRIORITY. The pump runs at normal priority, or below it when
 *   desc.below_normal is set: THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL on Windows, nice +5
 *   on the pump thread alone on Linux (setpriority(PRIO_PROCESS, tid), with
 *   the kernel task id from the gettid syscall, because Linux nice is
 *   per-task and PRIO_PROCESS with a thread id is how you reach one thread),
 *   and a Mach THREAD_PRECEDENCE_POLICY importance of -16 on macOS. Failing to
 *   lower is not an error; yrt_pump_policy() then reports
 *   YRT_POLICY_NORMAL instead of YRT_POLICY_BELOW_NORMAL, and those two
 *   are the only values it ever returns while the pump runs. On Windows the
 *   pump thread is also opted out of EcoQoS, below normal or not: priority
 *   decides who runs first, and EcoQoS decides on which core and how fast;
 *   minimized, an inference took about 1.25 times as long on the efficiency
 *   cores. See POWER THROTTLING.
 *
 *   The pump NEVER elevates. It does not call yrt_thread_elevate() and has
 *   no desc.sched. A thread that may hold a CPU for 30 ms must not be able to
 *   preempt the frame loop or a deadline worker, and a SCHED_FIFO thread that
 *   runs a Cholesky is a machine you cannot get the mouse back on. Inference
 *   is work that must FINISH; a trailing edge is work that must finish ON
 *   TIME. Only the second one belongs on the ladder. desc.pin_cpu is there for
 *   the other half of the same idea: pin the pump to a core the frame loop
 *   does not use and its cache footprint stops being the frame loop's problem.
 *
 *   STOP. yrt_pump_stop() refuses new submits first (they get
 *   YRT_ERR_STOPPED), then DRAINS: every message already in the ring is
 *   still delivered to on_msg, in order, before the thread is joined. A
 *   submitted response must not be lost because the session ended. Set
 *   desc.drop_on_stop and it discards the queue instead, keeping only the
 *   message already in flight, which cannot be un-run; those dropped messages
 *   never reach done_seq, so a yrt_pump_wait() on one of them returns
 *   YRT_ERR_STOPPED. Drain when the messages are data; drop when they are
 *   requests for a result nobody will read.
 *
 *   Both stop forms join the thread, so on_msg and on_idle are guaranteed not
 *   to be running when yrt_pump_stop() returns. That is what makes it safe
 *   to free or reuse the context and the ring afterwards. Stop is safe on a
 *   zeroed handle and on one already stopped.
 *
 *   yrt_pump_wait() is SAFE AGAINST A CONCURRENT STOP AT ANY POINT, and
 *   against a restart. A thread may sit in a loop of short waits while
 *   another stops and starts the pump as often as it likes; no wait touches a
 *   destroyed mutex, none hangs past its timeout, and each returns 0 (the seq
 *   was reached), YRT_ERR_TIMEOUT or YRT_ERR_STOPPED. The mechanism: a
 *   wait registers itself in an atomic counter before it looks at anything
 *   else, and backs out if the pump's mutexes are already gone; a stop marks
 *   them gone, lets every registered waiter out, and destroys nothing until
 *   the counter is zero. So a binding needs no wait slicing and no deferral
 *   of its own. The other calls keep the ordinary rule: do not race a submit,
 *   a lock or a start with a stop. One cost follows from the counter: a
 *   thread that calls yrt_pump_wait() in a tight loop on a pump that is
 *   stopping keeps the counter above zero part of the time, and the stop
 *   waits in 100 us polls until it catches a zero. The test's hammer does
 *   exactly that, with two such threads, and its 300 start-and-stop cycles
 *   took 0.4 to 4.3 s in all across Linux, Windows and node, thread creation
 *   included; a caller that sleeps between waits never sees it.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   EVENT RING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yrt_ring holds fixed 64-byte records, yrt_event, in memory you
 *   supply. Any thread pushes. One thread drains. It is the log primitive
 *   of the rig: the flip record, the audio onset, the video frame decision,
 *   restamped input and trace zones all go through a ring, and the drain
 *   writes them out in whatever format you choose.
 *
 *       static unsigned char mem[YRT_RING_BYTES(4096)];   // 256 KB + 64
 *       static yrt_ring ring;
 *       if (!yrt_ring_open(&ring, &(yrt_ring_desc){
 *               .memory = mem, .bytes = sizeof mem }))
 *           die(yrt_ring_error(&ring));
 *
 *       // any thread, an audio callback included; t_ns 0 = now, tid 0 = me
 *       yrt_ring_push(&ring, &(yrt_event){ .source = MY_SRC,
 *                                             .kind = ONSET,
 *                                             .u.i64 = { start_frame } });
 *
 *       // the frame thread, once per frame, after the flip
 *       yrt_event ev[64];
 *       for (int n; (n = yrt_ring_drain(&ring, ev, 64)) > 0; )
 *           for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) write_csv_row(&ev[i]);
 *
 *   examples/rt_ring_csv.c is the whole program. In C++17, zero a desc and
 *   an event and set their fields one by one.
 *
 *   THE RECORD. seq (written by the ring), tid, t_ns, source, kind, aux and
 *   a 40-byte payload with several views (i64, u64, f64, u32, u16, text,
 *   bytes). A zero t_ns gets the time of the push. A zero tid gets
 *   yrt_thread_id(). The source says who pushed the record. The kind says
 *   what it is, and its meaning belongs to the source. ysp/rt.h assigns the
 *   sources 1 to 255 to the ysp headers (YRT_SRC_*); an extension host
 *   assigns 256 to 32767; 32768 and up are yours. Records come out in the
 *   order the ring took them, which is each thread's push order. That is
 *   NOT time order: a record can carry a time in the future (an estimated
 *   onset) or in the past. Sort a batch by t_ns if you need time order.
 *
 *   WAIT-FREE PUSH. A push is a fixed sequence: one fetch-add on a count of
 *   used slots, one on the ticket counter, a copy of 60 bytes, and one
 *   release store that publishes the record. There is no lock, no retry
 *   loop, no allocation and, with t_ns and tid set, no system call. No
 *   thread ever waits for another inside a push, whatever its priority and
 *   whatever the other thread is doing. That holds where a fetch-add is one
 *   instruction: x86-64, ARMv8.1 and later with LSE atomics, and
 *   WebAssembly. On an ARMv8.0 core, and with MSVC on ARM64 below
 *   /arch:armv8.1, every atomic add is a retry loop in hardware, so the push
 *   is lock-free there, not wait-free.
 *
 *   A FULL RING refuses the new record. The push returns YRT_ERR_FULL,
 *   writes nothing and counts the refusal. The next drain puts a
 *   YRT_KIND_LOSS record first in its output (source YRT_SRC_RT), with
 *   the number lost since the previous drain in u.u64[0] and the total in
 *   u.u64[1]. A writer that copies every record out therefore cannot omit a
 *   loss. The ring keeps what it already holds and refuses what is new, so
 *   every record that comes out is whole and every gap is counted.
 *   yrt_ring_dropped() gives the total for a status line. With P threads
 *   inside a push at the same instant, a push can be refused when the ring
 *   is within P - 1 records of full.
 *
 *   A STALLED PRODUCER STALLS THE DRAIN. Records come out in ticket order,
 *   so the drain stops at a record whose producer took a ticket and has not
 *   yet written it. A push holds a ticket for a few dozen instructions. But
 *   a normal-priority producer that the OS deschedules inside that window
 *   holds it until it runs again, for a scheduler quantum or longer on a
 *   busy machine. During that time the drain returns nothing, the ring
 *   fills behind the stalled record, and then the ring refuses the next
 *   pushes, from every thread. The audio callback's records are then the
 *   ones that are lost, although the audio thread never waited. A producer
 *   that dies inside a push stops the drain for good. Size the ring for the
 *   longest stall you expect at the record rate you expect: capacity /
 *   rate is the stall the ring absorbs. For example, 4096 records at 6000
 *   records a second absorb a 0.68 s stall (arithmetic, not a measurement).
 *   Watch for LOSS records in the log, and give the ring more memory if any
 *   appear.
 *
 *   MEMORY. You own the memory and the handle; nothing allocates.
 *   YRT_RING_BYTES(n) is the size for n records. The ring aligns the
 *   start to 64 bytes and uses the largest power of two of slots that
 *   fits. yrt_ring_open() zeroes the memory, which also brings every page
 *   in before the first push. There is no close. Stop every producer before
 *   you free the memory or the handle, and detach the ring from the trace
 *   (yrt_trace_set_ring(NULL)) if it is attached.
 *
 *   ONE DRAINER. Call yrt_ring_drain() from one thread at a time. The
 *   ring does not detect a second drainer. A drain copies records out,
 *   frees their slots once per batch, and stops early when it reaches an
 *   unfinished record, so a short count does not mean an empty ring.
 *
 *   The ring is not a threading feature: it exists in a YRT_NO_THREADS
 *   build, because other libraries' threads still push.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CLOCK CORRELATION
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Every time in the rig is on the ysp_rt clock. A library that stamps
 *   with another clock (SDL's tick clock, Windows interrupt time, an audio
 *   device's frame count, an eye tracker) is converted at the boundary, and
 *   yrt_correlate() gives the pair of readings to convert with:
 *
 *       yrt_corr c;
 *       yrt_correlate(&(yrt_corr_desc){ .read = SDL_GetTicksNS }, &c);
 *       uint64_t t = c.rt_ns + (ev.common.timestamp - c.other);
 *
 *   PLAIN MODE reads the ysp_rt clock, the other clock, and the ysp_rt clock
 *   again, `tries` times (16 by default), and keeps the try with the
 *   smallest gap between the two ysp_rt reads. The other read happened
 *   inside that gap, so rt_ns is its middle and width_ns is the gap. The
 *   true ysp_rt time of `other` is within width_ns / 2 of rt_ns. The width
 *   is never 0: it is at least the ysp_rt clock's tick (the QPC period on
 *   Windows, clock_getres() on POSIX, the measured step under Emscripten),
 *   so a weight of 1 / width^2 is always finite. Plain mode cannot see the
 *   other clock's own tick: a 1 ms clock read in a 100 ns bracket is still
 *   wrong by up to 1 ms.
 *
 *   EDGE MODE (.edge = true) is for a coarse clock. It reads in a tight
 *   loop until the value changes, and brackets the change: from the start
 *   of the last read that saw the old value to the end of the first read
 *   that saw the new one. `other` is the new value, at the moment it began.
 *   It keeps the tightest of `tries` edges (4 by default) and spins the
 *   whole time, so the worst case is `tries` ticks of the other clock: 4 x
 *   15.6 ms = 62.5 ms for GetTickCount64 at the default Windows tick, and
 *   4 x 1 ms for a millisecond clock. timeout_ns (100 ms by default) ends
 *   the wait with YRT_ERR_TIMEOUT when the clock does not change at all.
 *   Correlate between trials, not inside a frame.
 *
 *   THE CLOCKS THE RIG NAMES:
 *     SDL3 ticks       .read = SDL_GetTicksNS. Plain mode. SDL2's
 *                      SDL_GetTicks counts milliseconds; use edge mode.
 *     Interrupt time   .read = yrt_interrupt_time_100ns, 100 ns units,
 *                      plain mode, Windows 10 and later; 0 elsewhere. It is
 *                      the clock GetTickCount64() and window message times
 *                      count in (in coarser steps; use edge mode for those).
 *                      It includes time the machine spent asleep.
 *     QPC values       No correlation: yrt_ticks_to_ns() converts them
 *                      exactly. See CLOCK.
 *     An audio device  A frame count, not a time. Read a position that the
 *                      API reports from any thread (WASAPI's
 *                      IAudioClock::GetPosition) through .read_ctx with the
 *                      device in .ctx. Or stamp the callback's own frame
 *                      count with yrt_now_ns() at callback entry and use
 *                      that pair as it is. To turn frames into time you also
 *                      need the device's true rate, which only repeated pairs
 *                      over a long time give: ysp/audio.h fits it itself,
 *                      and DEVICE CLOCK FIT below does it for other devices.
 *
 *   Push a correlation into the log as a YRT_KIND_CLOCK record, so the
 *   analysis can convert the other clock's stamps again later.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   DEVICE CLOCK FIT (yrt_fit)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A device with its own clock (a Cedrus XID box's ms timer, a
 *   microcontroller's micros(), an eye tracker) stamps its events with
 *   that clock. yrt_fit maps those stamps to the ysp_rt clock. Feed it
 *   pairs: the device's counter and the ysp_rt time that goes with it.
 *
 *       static yrt_fit fit;                  // about 40 KB: not on a stack
 *       yrt_fit_init(&fit, &(yrt_fit_desc){ .mode = YRT_FIT_LATE,
 *                                                .ns_per_tick = 1000.0,
 *                                                .tick_bits = 32 });
 *       // the reader thread, for each sync frame:
 *       yrt_fit_add(&fit, frame_us, (int64_t)t_read, 0);
 *       // for each event the device stamped:
 *       ev.t = yrt_fit_map(&fit, event_us);
 *
 *   MODES (desc.mode), by what the pair's host time is worth:
 *     LATE      The host time is when the reader got the bytes: late by
 *               the device's send, the USB poll, a bridge chip's latency
 *               timer, the driver and the thread's wake-up, never early.
 *               The map is the line under every point with the smallest
 *               summed gap, the edge of the lower convex hull that spans
 *               the mean x (Moon, Skelly and Towsley, INFOCOM 1999), as
 *               ysp/audio.h fits callback times. It finds the least late
 *               deliveries, so the map is the device's time plus the
 *               path's MINIMUM delay, which only a loopback measures.
 *     BRACKET   The device's time was read inside a bracket: a timer query
 *               sent at t0 and answered by t1, or a register latched by a
 *               write between t0 and t1. host_ns = t1, width_ns = t1 - t0.
 *               Brackets wider than max_width_ns (1.3 ms by default, as
 *               Psychtoolbox's DataPixx sync) are refused; the rest are
 *               fitted as LATE pairs, so per bucket the pair with the
 *               smallest t1 minus device time wins (PsychDataPixx's
 *               filter). The map is late by 0 to the width of the pairs it
 *               rests on (info.width_ns). Probing (how often, a random
 *               sub-millisecond wait between tries to leave the USB frame's
 *               phase) is the caller's.
 *     UNBIASED  The host time scatters both ways around the truth: a
 *               position report the API stamped at the source. Bucket
 *               means, least squares.
 *   THE WINDOW. One point per bucket of host time (desc.bucket_ns, 200
 *   ms): the least late pair (LATE, BRACKET) or the mean (UNBIASED).
 *   YRT_FIT_POINTS (1024) points, 205 s at 200 ms; the oldest leaves.
 *   The map is anchored at the newest point, so a recent event is mapped
 *   over a short distance. Until the points span desc.slope_span_ns (5 s)
 *   the slope stays nominal (ns_per_tick) and the offset comes from the
 *   last second's points, because a slope from a shorter span was worse
 *   than the drift it corrects (ysp/audio.h measured it); after that the
 *   slope is fitted, and info.ppm says how far the device's crystal is
 *   from nominal. A refit happens at every new bucket, at every pair
 *   while the window has 16 points or fewer, and when a LATE or BRACKET
 *   pair lies under the current line; otherwise a pair costs about 0.1 us
 *   (STATUS).
 *   WRAP. desc.tick_bits = 32 for a uint32 counter: XID's ms timer wraps
 *   after 49.7 days, micros() after 71.6 minutes. yrt_fit_add() unwraps
 *   a counter by the time the map expects at the pair's host time;
 *   yrt_fit_map() and yrt_fit_unwrap() unwrap against the newest pair,
 *   so map an event within half a wrap period of it (35 minutes for
 *   micros()). Pass the counter as the device sent it.
 *   RESTART. A pair farther than desc.restart_ns (50 ms) from the map is
 *   held, not used (YRT_FIT_PENDING). Held pairs that agree with each
 *   other at the nominal tick for desc.restart_hold_ns (1 s) are a new
 *   clock: the device's timer was reset (XID's e5), the board rebooted.
 *   The fit starts a new epoch from them (YRT_FIT_RESTART, info.epoch),
 *   with the slope nominal again. A normal pair ends the hold, and the
 *   held pairs count as rejected: a burst of late pairs after an OS stall
 *   arrives within milliseconds, so it never holds for a second. Map an
 *   event with the epoch it belongs to: an event stamped before a restart
 *   and mapped after it maps wrong. The nominal tick must be right to
 *   restart_ns over the longest gap between pairs in the first
 *   slope_span_ns, or the first pairs look like a new clock.
 *   ERROR. Synthetic devices in STATUS: a map within tens of us of the
 *   truth for dense LATE pairs, within 2 ns of the estimator's exact
 *   value. Few pairs behind a coarse timer (a press every few seconds
 *   behind a 16 ms FTDI latency timer) give ms errors for minutes; such a
 *   device needs BRACKET probes or a lower latency timer. info.spread_ns is
 *   the p99 distance of the points from the map (above it for LATE and
 *   BRACKET): a stamp's uncertainty for ysp/input.h's unc_us, not an
 *   error bound of the map; only a loopback gives that.
 *   RECORDS. With desc.ring, each closed bucket's point is a
 *   YRT_KIND_CLOCK record (the device's unwrapped ticks, the width, the
 *   epoch; aux = desc.clock_id) and each refit at a new bucket a
 *   YRT_KIND_FIT record (the anchor, ns per tick, the spread, the
 *   epoch, the points). An analysis can fit the whole session again from
 *   the CLOCK records, with the points after each event too, which an
 *   online fit cannot see. At most one of each per bucket.
 *   THREADS. A fit belongs to one thread (the device's reader); it takes
 *   no lock and allocates nothing. Exists in a YRT_NO_THREADS build.

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   INSTRUMENTATION
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Macros that mark what the code is doing, for a profiler or for the log:
 *
 *     YRT_ZONE(z, "name")      begin a zone; declares a local named z
 *     YRT_ZONE_VALUE(z, n)     attach a number to it
 *     YRT_ZONE_END(z)          end it
 *     YRT_FRAME_MARK()         the flip
 *     YRT_FRAME_MARK_NAMED(s)  the flip of a second display
 *     YRT_PLOT("name", x)      one point of a numeric plot
 *     YRT_MESSAGE("text")      a message, a string literal
 *     YRT_MESSAGEF(fmt, ...)   a formatted message
 *     YRT_THREAD_NAME("name")  name the calling thread
 *     YRT_THREAD_INIT("name")  name it and set up its per-thread state
 *     YRT_ZONE_SCOPED("name")  C++ only: a zone that ends with the scope
 *
 *       YRT_ZONE(z, "draw");
 *       draw_stimuli();
 *       YRT_ZONE_END(z);
 *       YRT_FRAME_MARK();
 *
 *   C has no destructors, so a zone is a pair. YRT_ZONE is a declaration:
 *   put it at block scope, as a statement of its own, not as the body of an
 *   unbraced if. Every path out of the zone needs its YRT_ZONE_END. Every
 *   name is a string literal, because the trace keeps the pointer. Do not
 *   give a macro an argument with a side effect: what it does depends on
 *   the mode.
 *
 *   THE MODE is one define for the whole program, on the compiler command
 *   line, because the first include of this header decides it:
 *
 *     (none)            Every macro is ((void)0) or ((void)sizeof(x)). No
 *                       code, and no argument is evaluated. sizeof is what
 *                       keeps a value computed only for a plot from being an
 *                       unused variable under -Werror.
 *     YRT_TRACE_RING  The macros push records into the trace ring set by
 *                       yrt_trace_set_ring(). One ZONE record per zone, at
 *                       its end, with the begin time, the duration and the
 *                       value; a zone left by an early return is not
 *                       recorded. FRAME, PLOT, MESSAGE (at most 39
 *                       characters) and THREAD_NAME push one record each.
 *                       With no ring attached a macro does one pointer load
 *                       and reads no clock. A rig without Tracy still gets
 *                       its zones in its log.
 *     YRT_TRACY       The macros call Tracy's C API (<tracy/TracyC.h>, or
 *                       the header YRT_TRACY_HEADER names). Define
 *                       TRACY_ENABLE too, or the build stops: without it
 *                       TracyC.h compiles every zone away and the profiler
 *                       shows nothing. Compile and link Tracy's
 *                       TracyClient.cpp into the program. The frame mark
 *                       also plots "yrt_ns", the ysp_rt time, so a
 *                       capture can be put on the rig's clock.
 *
 *   YRT_TRACY and YRT_TRACE_RING together stop the build.
 *   YRT_TRACE_WEB is reserved for a browser backend that does not exist
 *   yet, and also stops the build.
 *
 *   A REAL-TIME THREAD calls YRT_THREAD_INIT once, at its start, before it
 *   is on a deadline. Tracy allocates a queue for each thread on its first
 *   event, and the ring mode asks the OS for the thread id on its first
 *   record; both belong at the start, not in the first audio callback. The
 *   worker and the pump do it for their own threads before their start
 *   functions return.
 *
 *   What ysp/rt.h instruments itself: a "yrt.worker.job" zone around
 *   each worker job (value: its lateness in ns), "yrt.pump.msg" (value:
 *   the seq) and "yrt.pump.idle" around the pump's callbacks, and
 *   "yrt.sleep" around the wait in yrt_sleep_until(). The mode of the
 *   translation unit that defines YSP_RT_IMPLEMENTATION decides whether
 *   these exist. The trace-ring functions are always compiled in, so any
 *   other translation unit may use YRT_TRACE_RING whatever that mode is.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   WEBASSEMBLY
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Under Emscripten (__EMSCRIPTEN__) the header compiles as a subset of its
 *   POSIX path. What a wasm module can and cannot have, call by call:
 *
 *     Clock    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC), which Emscripten backs with
 *              performance.now() in a browser and the high-resolution timer
 *              in node. Browsers COARSEN performance.now() to between 5 us
 *              and 100 us (by browser and version) unless the page is
 *              cross-origin isolated (COOP and COEP headers), which also
 *              enables threads; an isolated page gets a finer clock, how much
 *              finer being the browser's decision, which is why it is
 *              measured below and not stated here. Every
 *              read is a call out to JavaScript, so it costs far more than a
 *              native read. Emscripten's clock_getres() reports 1 ns whatever
 *              the host does, so on this platform, and only here,
 *              yrt_get_clock_info() MEASURES the smallest step two reads
 *              can see and reports that instead. Log it: it is the
 *              resolution of every timestamp you take.
 *     Waits    yrt_sleep_until() is the relative nanosleep loop macOS uses,
 *              then the spin. In a pthread (a Web Worker) or on node's main
 *              thread that is a real blocking wait on a futex. On a
 *              BROWSER'S MAIN THREAD it is not usable: blocking there freezes
 *              rendering and input, and Emscripten turns a main-thread sleep
 *              into a busy-wait. The browser frame loop belongs to
 *              requestAnimationFrame, which is where a stimulus is drawn; the
 *              waits in this header are for worker threads, node, and tools.
 *              A build WITHOUT -pthread has no futex at all, and every sleep
 *              in it is a busy-wait even under node.
 *     Ladder   Collapsed. A wasm thread is a Web Worker and no page can ask
 *              for its priority, so yrt_thread_elevate() returns
 *              YRT_POLICY_NORMAL without trying (Emscripten's scheduling
 *              stubs report success and would be believed otherwise);
 *              yrt_thread_pin(), yrt_thread_set_timer_slack(),
 *              yrt_process_lock_memory() and
 *              yrt_timer_resolution_begin() return false; and
 *              yrt_describe() ends its line with "platform=wasm
 *              ladder=none" so a log cannot mistake NORMAL for a refusal. The
 *              pump's below-normal rung is YRT_POLICY_NORMAL here.
 *     Threads  The worker and the pump need -pthread, and in a browser the
 *              page must be cross-origin isolated for SharedArrayBuffer to
 *              exist. Built without -pthread they still compile and link
 *              (Emscripten provides pthread stubs), and start() fails with a
 *              message that names the missing flag; YRT_NO_THREADS drops
 *              them as on every other platform. With -pthread, build the
 *              program with -sPROXY_TO_PTHREAD=1 so main() itself runs on a
 *              pthread and may block, and -sEXIT_RUNTIME=1 so its return code
 *              reaches node. This is the configuration the tests run in:
 *
 *       emcc -O2 -pthread -sPROXY_TO_PTHREAD=1 -sEXIT_RUNTIME=1 -Iinclude \
 *            -o rt_pump.js examples/rt_pump.c && node rt_pump.js
 *
 *              Node 24 runs threaded modules with no extra flag. The
 *              adaptive headers' tests also want -sSTACK_SIZE=16MB,
 *              -sINITIAL_MEMORY=64MB and -sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1; with
 *              -pthread, emcc warns that memory growth is slower for
 *              JavaScript code (-Wpthreads-mem-growth), which does not touch
 *              anything here and can be silenced.
 *
 *   What this buys a browser experiment is the pump: the frame loop stays in
 *   requestAnimationFrame on the main thread, a QUEST+ or GP update runs on
 *   a pump thread, and the frame callback polls yrt_pump_done_seq() exactly
 *   as a native loop does. No timing claim in this header survives the trip
 *   to a browser unchanged; run examples/rt_jitter.c under the runtime you
 *   will use and log its ysp_rt: line.
 *
 *     Ring     With -pthread the ring's atomics are wasm's, and a push from
 *              a pthread or an AudioWorklet thread is wait-free as on a
 *              native core. Without -pthread there is no shared memory and
 *              emcc turns the atomics into plain loads and stores, which is
 *              correct for the one thread there is. yrt_thread_id() is
 *              the pthread handle. yrt_correlate()'s width floor is the
 *              measured clock step, taken once per process (up to 5 ms).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   POSIX builds link -pthread: the worker needs it, and so does the
 *   scheduling ladder, which raises the calling thread through
 *   pthread_setschedparam even when the worker is compiled out. On glibc
 *   older than 2.17 also link -lrt for clock_gettime. macOS needs nothing
 *   extra. Windows needs no import library: winmm is loaded at runtime and
 *   only by yrt_timer_resolution_begin().
 *
 *   Define YRT_NO_THREADS to drop the worker and the pump. That removes
 *   yrt_worker, yrt_pump and every yrt_worker_* / yrt_pump_*
 *   declaration, so code that uses them must guard the same way. The clock,
 *   the waits, the whole scheduling section, the event ring, the clock
 *   correlation, the instrumentation macros, the YRT_ERR_* codes and
 *   yrt_strerror() stay: none of them starts a thread.
 *
 *   Define YRT_TRACE_RING or YRT_TRACY, for the whole program, to turn
 *   the instrumentation macros on; see INSTRUMENTATION. YRT_TRACY needs
 *   TRACY_ENABLE, Tracy's public/ directory on the include path and
 *   TracyClient.cpp in the build:
 *
 *       c++ -O2 -DTRACY_ENABLE -DTRACY_ON_DEMAND -Itracy/public \
 *           -c tracy/public/TracyClient.cpp
 *       cc -O2 -pthread -DYRT_TRACY -DTRACY_ENABLE -DTRACY_ON_DEMAND -Iinclude \
 *           -Itracy/public -c app.c
 *       c++ -pthread -o app app.o TracyClient.o -ldl
 *
 *   Define YRT_PUMP_INLINE_BYTES to size the ring a pump gets when
 *   yrt_pump_desc.ring is NULL (4096 by default). It sits inside every
 *   yrt_pump handle whether or not it is used, so a program that always
 *   supplies its own ring can set it to 1 and a program with 8 KB messages
 *   raises it. It must be the same in every translation unit that sees a
 *   yrt_pump.
 *
 *   Define YRT_API to override the default `extern` linkage.
 *
 *       cc -O2 -pthread -Iinclude -o rt_jitter examples/rt_jitter.c
 *       cl /O2 /Iinclude examples\rt_jitter.c
 *       emcc -O2 -pthread -sPROXY_TO_PTHREAD=1 -sEXIT_RUNTIME=1 -Iinclude \
 *            -o rt_jitter.js examples/rt_jitter.c     # then: node rt_jitter.js
