/* ysp/video.h - v0.2.1 - public domain single-header video playback library
 *
 *   A movie as a stimulus. On each display frame the header takes the
 *   frame's PREDICTED ONSET, asks the movie clock for the movie time at
 *   that onset, and shows the video frame due then, by ysp/timeline.h's
 *   lead rule. It never counts frames. Every display frame gets a record:
 *   the video frame, when it was due, when the flip showed it, and the
 *   decision (shown, repeated, dropped) with its reason. Frames are decoded
 *   ahead on a ysp/rt.h pump and uploaded into a ysp/gfx.h IMAGE texture.
 *   Also a frame sequence container (raw or QOI frames, read and write,
 *   value-exact), MPEG-1 through pl_mpeg, H.264 and HEVC in MP4 through
 *   Media Foundation on Windows, and the Video decoder extension interface
 *   of the rig's spec (section 12).
 *
 *   REQUIRES ysp/gfx.h (so ysp/screen.h and ysp/rt.h) and ysp/timeline.h
 *   beside it. pl_mpeg.h (commit c871f2b, one MIT file) on the include path
 *   for MPEG-1; YVID_NO_PL_MPEG builds without it. Media Foundation is an
 *   OS API, loaded at run time (BUILDING); YVID_NO_MF builds without it.
 *   ysp/audio.h is optional: include it first and yvid_follow_audio()
 *   and yvid_soundtrack() appear.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. C99 is
 *   the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC
 *   compiles by default.

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.2.1 - Fixed: after a decoder's YVID_PENDING the decode thread
 *          slept until the next seek or control, so a custom decoder that
 *          stalled once showed no new frame again (the frame on screen
 *          REPEATED with DECODE_LATE). It now asks again once a display
 *          frame, and catches up as before: it decodes the due frame (from
 *          its keyframe), and the frames passed over are DROPPED with
 *          DECODE_LATE. The built-in backends never return PENDING.
 *   v0.2.0 - Media Foundation (Windows): H.264 and HEVC (8-bit 4:2:0) in
 *          MP4, decoded into NV12 by the software decoder or DXVA
 *          (desc.hw_decode; AUTO is DXVA, by measurement). yvid_index_make()
 *          makes the index of an MP4 file too: B-frames, a rate that no
 *          frame grid fits, a varying GOP, an edit list, interlace,
 *          rotation, non-square pixels, 10-bit and 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 are
 *          refused by name, the color is read from the H.264 SPS, and every
 *          keyframe is decoded again after a seek to prove it is a clean
 *          entry point. Planar upload: a YUV slot holds its planes and
 *          ysp/gfx.h's video program converts them, so light EOTF works;
 *          the CPU conversion left the play path (yvid_yuv_to_rgba()
 *          stays). YVID_PATH_GPU: DXVA on the screen's device, one GPU
 *          copy a frame, no readback and no upload. yvid_soundtrack(): a
 *          WAV played as a ysp/audio.h stream, locked to the picture by
 *          yvid_follow_audio(). Base rates: the movie plays at its
 *          ysp/timeline.h base's rate. Fixed: after a PENDING decode the
 *          decode thread pushed its slot onto the free queue, whose one
 *          producer is the frame thread (a data race). Breaking:
 *          yvid_index_desc gains backend, hw and no_seek_check;
 *          yvid_desc gains hw_decode and yvid_info gains hw;
 *          YVID_PATH_ZERO_COPY is now YVID_PATH_GPU; a YUV movie's
 *          texture is YGFX_NV12 or YGFX_I420, not RGBA8; light AUTO is
 *          EOTF under a calibration; a file that is not a frame sequence,
 *          MPEG-PS or MP4 is refused at open.
 *   v0.1.0 - first release: the scheduler (due frame by the timeline's
 *          lead rule, cadence, slips, drops and repeats with reasons), the
 *          movie clock read from a ysp_timeline base, the decoder
 *          interface, the frame sequence container (raw, QOI), pl_mpeg
 *          with its index, decode-ahead on a pump, upload through
 *          ysp/gfx.h, I420 and NV12 converted to RGBA8 on the decode
 *          thread, manual mode, seek, loop, the records.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.2.0, on one Windows 11 laptop (i7-1360P, Iris Xe, ANGLE),
 *   in a 640 x 360 composed window (tier 2); docs/video.md has the
 *   tables. Measured at 1920 x 1080 with Media Foundation: yvid_update()
 *   on the frame thread with the planar upload 0.39 to 0.61 ms mean, 0.7
 *   to 1.3 ms p99 (v0.1's RGBA8 upload 0.9 to 1.07 / 1.5 to 2.0 ms), a
 *   repeat 0.01 ms, YVID_PATH_GPU 0.01 to 0.02 ms. The decode thread at
 *   1080p60: DXVA 5.3 ms mean, 8.5 ms p99 a frame; the software decoder
 *   1.9 / 3.3 ms on it but 13 to 21 ms of CPU a frame on Media
 *   Foundation's threads. Open 115 to 308 ms cold; a seek 32 to 42 ms mean
 *   with DXVA, about 155 ms with the software decoder. pl_mpeg 5.5 ms a
 *   1080p frame. The soundtrack on the real device (WASAPI shared, 48 kHz):
 *   each start within 14 us of its target on ysp_audio's fit, and the
 *   flips' onsets within -0.42 to +0.08 ms (p1 to p99) of each frame's
 *   time on the audio clock, outside a few frames the composed window
 *   flipped a vblank early or late; no gap, no underrun. No heap call per
 *   frame. The core test (a scripted decoder, display and audio device on
 *   a virtual clock; with YVID_TEST_MEDIA the generated MP4 clips)
 *   passes on MSVC 19.44 (C, C++17), MinGW gcc 16.1 (C99, C++17) and gcc
 *   11.4 (C99 -O3, ASan and UBSan, ThreadSanitizer); emcc ran for v0.1.
 *   Mutations: 23 of 23 (v0.1), 29 of 31 (v0.2; two Media Foundation
 *   checks not caught, docs/video.md says why). Not measured: light
 *   and sound (no photodiode or microphone), fullscreen, slips on the
 *   real panel, another GPU. Not built: YVID_PATH_SHARED, AVFoundation, FFmpeg,
 *   capture; open() refuses the ones a desc can ask for, by name.
 *   Outside it and this block, a number in this header is a measurement
 *   only where the text says "measured".
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_VIDEO_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header. It brings the
 *   implementations of ysp/gfx.h, ysp/screen.h, ysp/rt.h and
 *   ysp/timeline.h with it, once, and pl_mpeg's (BUILDING).
 *
 *   Play a movie, centered at 1:1:
 *
 *       static yscr_screen scr; static ygfx_gfx gfx; static yvid_movie mv;
 *       yscr_open(&scr, &(yscr_desc){0});
 *       ygfx_open(&gfx, &(ygfx_desc){ .screen = &scr });
 *       if (!yvid_open(&mv, &gfx, &(yvid_desc){ .path = "clip.yspseq" }))
 *           die(yvid_error(&mv));
 *       ygfx_stim film = yvid_stim(&mv, &(yvid_stim_desc){0});
 *       yvid_play_at(&mv, YVID_ASAP);
 *       yscr_frame f;
 *       while (yscr_begin(&scr, &f) == YSCR_OK && yvid_update(&mv, &f) == YVID_OK) {
 *           ygfx_begin(&gfx, &f); ygfx_draw(&gfx, &film); ygfx_end(&gfx);
 *           yscr_flip(&scr);
 *       }
 *
 *   The loop ends at the movie's end, or when yscr_begin() stops (Shift+Esc
 *   by default, ysp/screen.h's abort).
 *
 *   Psychtoolbox and PsychoPy, for comparison (from their documentation):
 *
 *       movie = Screen('OpenMovie', win, 'clip.mp4');               % PTB
 *       Screen('PlayMovie', movie, 1);
 *       while true
 *           tex = Screen('GetMovieImage', win, movie);
 *           if tex <= 0, break; end
 *           Screen('DrawTexture', win, tex); Screen('Flip', win); Screen('Close', tex);
 *       end
 *
 *       mov = visual.MovieStim(win, 'clip.mp4')                     # PsychoPy
 *       mov.play()
 *       while not mov.isFinished:
 *           mov.draw(); win.flip()
 *
 *   The differences: the stimulus is a ysp/gfx.h IMAGE (place, anchor,
 *   size, ori, opacity, groups and timeline bindings work as for any
 *   image) whose texture the movie rewrites, so it does not change from
 *   frame to frame. yvid_update() picks the frame due at f.onset; it
 *   never waits and never reads a clock. The file must be in the canonical
 *   form (CANONICAL FORM); the others accept any file and convert rate,
 *   size and color without a record. There is no rate argument. In C++17,
 *   zero a desc and set its fields one by one.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TIME
 *     Times are int64_t ns on the ysp/rt.h clock. A movie time is ns from
 *     the start of frame 0. Video frame i covers movie time
 *     [t(i), t(i+1)) with t(i) = ceil(i * den * 1e9 / num) for the rate
 *     num/den (yvid_frame_time). The ceiling makes an integer comparison
 *     with t(i) the same as the exact rational one.
 *
 *   THE DUE FRAME (yvid_due)
 *     On a display frame with predicted onset T and period P, with m the
 *     movie time at T and L = lead x P truncated to whole ns, the due frame
 *     is the largest i with t(i) <= m + L. This is ysp/timeline.h's
 *     QUANTIZATION rule, so an annotation at t(i) on the movie base fires
 *     on the display frame that first shows frame i, with the same lead.
 *     desc.lead: 0 means 0.5 (the nearest display frame; onset noise of
 *     microseconds never moves a frame), YVID_LEAD_NONE never early
 *     (Psychtoolbox's "most recent frame"). With desc.timeline the
 *     timeline's own lead is used, and a different desc.lead is refused.
 *
 *   THE MOVIE CLOCK
 *     With desc.timeline and desc.base (1..7), the movie time at T is that
 *     base's time at T (ytl_base_time). yvid_play_at, pause_at, seek
 *     and loop anchor, pause and rewind the base; the caller evaluates the
 *     timeline after yvid_update() as usual, and annotations on the base
 *     fire on the display frame that shows them. The movie plays at the
 *     base's rate (BASE RATES). Without a timeline the header keeps its
 *     own anchor with the same arithmetic, at rate 1. A seek moves the base with
 *     ytl_skip(): the annotations it passes over are marked
 *     YTL_EV_SKIPPED and never fire, and the one at the target fires on
 *     the frame that shows it; the SEEK record counts the skipped ones.
 *     yvid_follow_audio() (with ysp/audio.h) or yvid_follow() re-anchors
 *     the movie clock every frame from another clock. With a soundtrack
 *     (SOUNDTRACK) the movie time is the soundtrack's sample at the onset,
 *     read through ysp_audio's fit; without one, the device's stream
 *     position since movie time 0. Audio is never resampled; video follows
 *     by showing the frame due, so frames repeat or drop when the two
 *     clocks slip.
 *
 *   CADENCE AND SLIPS
 *     At open the header compares the refresh R (desc.refresh_num/den, or
 *     the screen's mode) with the rate r. Within 200 ppm of an integer
 *     multiple k, each frame is due for k display frames; repeats there are
 *     DUE. Otherwise the cadence judders (23.976 fps on 60 Hz: 3, 2, 3, 2
 *     display frames per frame), as in Psychtoolbox's default movie mode:
 *     a showing beyond floor(R/r) is REPEATED with reason CADENCE, and a
 *     frame the refresh cannot show (r > R) is DROPPED with reason
 *     CADENCE. No tier penalty: the cadence is a property of the stimulus,
 *     and yvid_describe() states it with the frame durations.
 *     desc.strict_cadence refuses a refresh that is not a multiple (at
 *     open; at a change of base rate, BASE RATES).
 *     Each decision is also checked against a nominal schedule: the movie
 *     time the clock would give if it ran in step with the vblank count at
 *     the nominal period. A difference is a slip, reason DRIFT: the movie
 *     clock and the display grid run at different rates (13 ppm on the
 *     laptop panel: one slip every 21 minutes at 30 fps), or onset noise
 *     met a frame boundary exactly. The schedule restarts at each slip.
 *
 *   DECISIONS (yvid_record.decision, .why)
 *     j is the frame on screen, i the due frame, e the nominal due frame.
 *       i = j, i = e      REPEATED j, DUE or CADENCE (above)
 *       i = j, i != e     REPEATED j, DRIFT
 *       i > j, ready      SHOWN i (DUE; DRIFT when i != e; SEEK, LOOP or
 *                         MANUAL after those); frames j+1..i-1 DROPPED
 *       i > j, not ready  the newest ready frame after j that is not later
 *                         than i is SHOWN with DECODE_LATE, else j is
 *                         REPEATED with DECODE_LATE
 *     A dropped run is DECODE_LATE when its frames were due before they
 *     were ready, DISPLAY_LATE when the vblank count jumped (the flip
 *     before missed its vblank), CADENCE when the nominal schedule drops
 *     them too, and DRIFT otherwise. A frame is never shown late as if it
 *     were on time.
 *
 *   SEEK, LOOP, END, MANUAL
 *     yvid_seek(mt, resume) and yvid_seek_frame(i, resume) post the
 *     target to the decode thread. The frame on screen stays and FRAME
 *     records stop until the target is ready; the movie resumes at
 *     `resume` (YVID_ASAP: once desc.preroll frames are ready;
 *     YVID_STAY_PAUSED: shows the target and stays paused) with movie
 *     time t(target). A codec seeks to the keyframe at or before the target
 *     and decodes forward without keeping the frames; closed GOPs and no
 *     B-frames make that exact. desc.loop: after frame N-1 comes frame 0;
 *     the movie clock's base is rewound to 0 at t(N), so annotations fire
 *     again (1 ns of rounding per loop at a rate that is not a whole number
 *     of ns per frame). Without loop, yvid_update() returns YVID_ENDED
 *     from the first display frame whose due frame is N or later; the last
 *     frame stays in the texture. yvid_show(i) before yvid_update()
 *     shows frame i on this display frame (MANUAL), and the movie base is
 *     held at t(i): a step to the next frame fires the annotations up to
 *     t(i), a jump skips the ones it passes over. A frame outside the
 *     decoded window is a seek of the decoder, and the record says so.
 *
 *   CANONICAL FORM (checked at open)
 *     One rate num/den, one size and pixel format, closed GOPs of a
 *     constant length, no B-frames, and a stated color: matrix (BT.601,
 *     BT.709, BT.2020 NCL), range, transfer, primaries and chroma siting.
 *     "Unspecified" is refused. 10-bit is refused. A frame sequence holds
 *     its own description; an MPEG-1 or MP4 file needs its index beside it
 *     (path + ".yspvi"), made by yvid_index_make() (the pack tool's step): its
 *     description, the media file's size and the hashes of its first and
 *     last 64 KB, and the XXH64 of every decoded frame. Each value the
 *     backend reports must equal the index's. During play every frame's
 *     timestamp must map to the frame expected (else YVID_F_TS_MISMATCH)
 *     and every frame decoded on the CPU must hash to the index's value
 *     (else YVID_F_HASH_MISMATCH); the frame is still shown and the
 *     describe line says the file is not canonical.
 *
 *   MEDIA FOUNDATION (Windows; desc.backend MF, or AUTO for an MP4 file)
 *     An IMFSourceReader, synchronous, used on the decode thread. MP4 with
 *     one H.264 (Baseline, Main, High) or HEVC Main video track; an audio
 *     track is ignored. The reader may not add a converter or a video
 *     processor: the decoder gives NV12 itself or the file is refused.
 *     desc.hw_decode: OFF is Microsoft's software decoder; DXVA the
 *     decoder on a D3D11 device of its own (VIDEO_SUPPORT, on the screen's
 *     adapter) with each kept frame read back; AUTO is DXVA, and the
 *     software decoder when no DXVA device opens. Measured at 1080p60
 *     (docs/video.md): DXVA costs 5.3 ms a frame on the decode thread
 *     (most of it the readback) and about 1 ms of Media Foundation's CPU;
 *     the software decoder 1.9 ms on the decode thread but 13 to 21 ms of
 *     CPU on Media Foundation's threads, more than a core at 60 fps. DXVA
 *     seeks 4 to 5 times faster and opens about 100 ms slower. A hardware
 *     decoder MFT that writes system memory was measured too and removed:
 *     it cost as much CPU as the software decoder. Every decoder gave the
 *     index's bytes on every frame of the test clips: H.264 decoding is
 *     exact by the standard, so one index serves them all, and a decoder
 *     that differs is a HASH_MISMATCH, not a tolerance.
 *     The rate is the index's: Media Foundation reports a 100 ns
 *     approximation (24000/1001 comes out 10000000/417083). Media
 *     Foundation does not report the color the stream states, so
 *     yvid_index_make() reads it from the H.264 SPS (its VUI): a desc
 *     field that contradicts the stream is refused, and a field nobody
 *     states is refused. HEVC's color comes from the desc. The index maker
 *     refuses B-frames, frame times that fit no constant rate (to 100 ns),
 *     a GOP that changes, an edit list in the video track (Media
 *     Foundation plays a start offset from 0, other players do not),
 *     interlace, rotation, non-square pixels, 10-bit, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4, and
 *     a keyframe that does not decode to the same bytes after a seek. COM:
 *     open() keeps a multithreaded apartment alive (CoIncrementMTAUsage),
 *     so the decode thread needs no COM setup and the frame thread may be
 *     in a single-threaded apartment, as SDL3 leaves it. A path, memory and
 *     a yvid_reader all reach Media Foundation through one IStream, whose
 *     read() Media Foundation calls from its own threads, one at a time.
 *
 *   GPU PATH (desc.gpu_path YVID_PATH_GPU; Windows, Media Foundation)
 *     DXVA decodes on the screen's own D3D11 device, and the decode thread
 *     copies each kept frame on the GPU (CopySubresourceRegion) into one of
 *     the movie's NV12 textures, which ysp/gfx.h imported once at open
 *     (ygfx_texture_import). Nothing is read back or uploaded; the frame
 *     thread rebinds the stimulus to the due slot's texture
 *     (ygfx_texture_rebind), and the slot on screen is not decoded into
 *     until another replaces it. The decoder's own surfaces are not held:
 *     it has about nine, and holding them for decode-ahead stalls it. The
 *     copy and the draw go through one immediate context, which orders
 *     them, so there is no fence. Needs ygfx_features() with
 *     YGFX_FEAT_IMPORT_NV12, a screen with a D3D11 device (the DXGI_FLIP
 *     or COMPOSITION backend) made with VIDEO_SUPPORT and multithread
 *     protection (ysp/screen.h's desc.d3d11_video), and hw_decode AUTO
 *     or DXVA; open() refuses otherwise, by name. The timestamps are
 *     checked; the frame hashes are not (the frame never reaches the CPU).
 *     Against UPLOAD on the test clips: the same value at every pixel.
 *     Measured at 1080p (docs/video.md, M7): 20 to 50 % less process
 *     CPU and no slot memory. On the frame thread the upload leaves, but
 *     the draw and flip wait longer on the shared context (p99 1.5 to 8 ms
 *     against 0.9 to 2 ms); dropped frames in a composed window did not
 *     separate the paths. UPLOAD stays the default: it needs no video
 *     device and has the shorter tail.
 *     YVID_PATH_SHARED (a second device) is not built.
 *
 *   DECODE-AHEAD AND UPLOAD
 *     Each movie has its own ysp/rt.h pump at normal priority (desc.pin_cpu
 *     pins it). The pump decodes one frame per idle call into a free slot
 *     until desc.ahead frames are ready, then blocks until the frame
 *     thread frees a slot. Frames older than the due frame are decoded
 *     without being kept (a P-frame needs its reference), or skipped by a
 *     seek to the next keyframe when that is shorter. A slot holds the
 *     frame as decoded: I420 or NV12 planes with tight rows, or the frame
 *     sequence's own format. yvid_update() uploads the due frame with
 *     ygfx_texture_update_planes() into a YGFX_I420 or YGFX_NV12
 *     texture (ygfx_texture_update() for the other formats) and ends the
 *     frame's YSCR_PHASE_UPLOAD. ysp/gfx.h updates textures only between
 *     frames: call it after yscr_begin() and before ygfx_begin().
 *     ysp/gfx.h's video program converts YUV with the canonical form's
 *     matrix, range and siting (desc.chroma NEAREST replicates chroma).
 *     desc.light: CODES shows the R'G'B' codes as device values; EOTF
 *     decodes the stated transfer and primaries to linear light, so the
 *     movie goes through the screen's calibration like any stimulus; AUTO
 *     is EOTF for a YUV movie when ysp/gfx.h has a calibration
 *     (ygfx_calibrated), else CODES. EOTF is for YUV movies; an RGB frame
 *     sequence holds device values. Slots: ahead + 2 of the frame's bytes
 *     (1.5 a pixel for YUV), one allocation at open (or desc.mem); none on
 *     the GPU path. Nothing allocates per frame on either thread
 *     (yvid_heap_calls()). yvid_yuv_to_rgba() is the CPU conversion
 *     v0.1 ran on the pump, kept as a tool (an export, a test): integer
 *     arithmetic within 1 code of a double reference.
 *     desc.inline_decode runs the decode step inside yvid_update()
 *     instead, so a run is a pure function of its inputs (tests).
 *
 *   SOUNDTRACK (yvid_soundtrack, with ysp/audio.h)
 *     A WAV (path, memory or a yvid_reader) at the device's rate, played
 *     as a ysp/audio.h stream (yau_wav): a voice like any other, placed,
 *     recorded and confirmed by ysp_audio, and mixed with yau_play_at()
 *     sounds. Call it after yvid_open() and before the first play. The
 *     movie's decode thread fills the stream's ring (1 s by default). Sample
 *     s plays at movie time s / rate: a start at movie time mt begins with
 *     the sample nearest mt (a tie to the earlier). With YVID_ASAP the
 *     start is the first predicted display onset both can reach (at or
 *     after now + yau_lead_ns() + one display period, once the frames
 *     and the ring are in), and the movie base is anchored there, so sound
 *     and picture share one origin. A pause stops the sound at its target and a resume
 *     starts it again. A seek during play stops it at once (the desc's
 *     ramp_ns fades it), the decode thread moves the WAV to the target's
 *     sample once ysp_audio has ended the play, the ring refills, and the
 *     movie resumes at the next shared ASAP target with a new play.
 *     desc.loop loops the WAV with the movie, sample numbers continuing.
 *     yvid_follow_audio() then takes each display frame's movie time from
 *     the soundtrack's sample at the onset. Refused, by name: a WAV whose
 *     length is not the movie's duration in samples (N x den x rate / num,
 *     rounded to the nearest, a tie up), a loop whose duration is not a
 *     whole number of samples, and a base rate other than 1 (no
 *     resampling; a later change of rate stops the sound and
 *     yvid_update() returns YVID_ERR_REFUSED once). ysp/audio.h refuses
 *     a rate or a channel count that is not the device's.
 *
 *   BASE RATES (ytl_rate on the movie base, with desc.timeline)
 *     The movie plays at its base's rate: 1/2 is half speed, 2/1 double.
 *     The due frame is the largest i with t(i) at or before the base time
 *     at RT onset + L (ytl_window), so the lead stays in RT ns and an
 *     annotation at t(i) still fires on the display frame that shows frame
 *     i. yvid_update() reads the rate on every display frame. At a
 *     change, the cadence is computed again for R against r x num/den, the
 *     nominal schedule restarts (a change is not a slip), and a
 *     YVID_EV_RATE record says so. Under desc.strict_cadence a rate whose
 *     cadence judders holds the frame on screen and yvid_update() returns
 *     YVID_ERR_REFUSED until the rate gives a multiple again or the movie
 *     closes; a seek alone does not clear it (it lands, then holds). At
 *     rate 1 the records are those of v0.1.0, byte for byte.

 *   RECORDS (desc.ring; source YRT_SRC_VIDEO, aux desc.movie_index)
 *     YVID_EV_FRAME, one per display frame while playing, pushed when its
 *     flip record arrives (yscr_frame.done in a later yvid_update(), or
 *     yvid_flip_done() from yscr_on_flip()):
 *       t_ns       the flip's onset; the predicted onset when the flip has
 *                  no record (YVID_F_ESTIMATED) or was never shown
 *       u.i64[0]   video frame index
 *       u.i64[1]   due: the RT time of the frame's start on the movie clock
 *       u.i64[2]   the movie time at the predicted onset
 *       u.u32[6]   flags (YVID_F_*)
 *       u.u16[14]  decision bits 0..1, why bits 2..5, tier bits 6..8,
 *                  path bits 9..10 (YVID_EV_DECISION_OF() and friends)
 *       u.u16[15]  frames ready ahead
 *       u.u32[8]   display frames this video frame has been on screen
 *       u.u32[9]   the display frame index, low 32 bits: the word
 *                  YSCR_EV_FLIP carries, so a join needs no table
 *     The residual is t_ns - u.i64[1]; with the audio clock it is the A/V
 *     error of that frame. Other kinds:
 *       YVID_EV_DROP    t_ns due time of the first, i64[0] first frame,
 *                         i64[1] count, u16[14] why, u32[9] display index
 *       YVID_EV_OPEN    i32[0..5] w, h, format, fps num, den, codec;
 *                         i32[6] backend, i32[7] multiple (0 = judder),
 *                         u32[8] color word (matrix | range << 8 |
 *                         transfer << 16 | primaries << 24), i32[9] ahead
 *       YVID_EV_PLAY, _PAUSE  t_ns the display frame's onset, i64[0]
 *                         movie time, i64[1] id, i64[2] frame, i64[3] the
 *                         requested time (0 = ASAP)
 *       YVID_EV_SEEK    t_ns the onset that showed the target, i64[0]
 *                         target, i64[1] keyframe used, i64[2] frames
 *                         decoded and discarded, i64[3] the onset of the
 *                         request, u32[8] id, u32[9] annotations
 *                         skipped on the movie base
 *       YVID_EV_LOOP    t_ns onset, i64[0] cycle
 *       YVID_EV_END     t_ns onset, i64[0] last frame shown
 *       YVID_EV_CLOCK   t_ns anchor, i64[0] the other clock's unit at
 *                         movie time 0, i64[1] its rate
 *       YVID_EV_DECODE  t_ns start, i64[0] the decode's length in ns,
 *                         i64[1] frame: one decode longer than a frame
 *       YVID_EV_SOUND   t_ns the target (now for a stop at once);
 *                         i64[0] ysp_audio's play id, i64[1] the first
 *                         sample (a start) or -1 (a stop), i64[2] the
 *                         target, u32[8] 1 start, 2 stop, u32[9] the
 *                         control's id. ysp_audio's ONSET, STREAM, GAP and
 *                         END records under YRT_SRC_AUDIO carry the rest
 *       YVID_EV_RATE    t_ns onset; i32[0] num, i32[1] den, i32[2] the
 *                         multiple (0 = judder), f64[2] display frames per
 *                         video frame, u32[8] 1 when strict_cadence refuses
 *     Controls (play_at, pause_at, seek) return an id > 0; yvid_result()
 *     gives its PLAY, PAUSE or SEEK record once it happened.
 *
 *   TIERS
 *     A FRAME record carries its flip's tier (yscr_tier numbering): the
 *     decision says what was shown, the tier how well the onset is known.
 *     desc.min_tier flags worse frames YVID_F_BELOW_TIER; the movie goes
 *     on. A timestamp or hash mismatch is a fault, not a tier.
 *
 *   FRAME SEQUENCE (yvid_seq_*)
 *     One little-endian file. A 4096-byte header (magic YSPVSEQ1, size,
 *     format, compression, rate, frame count, color, index offset, XXH64 of
 *     the header), then per frame a 64-byte frame header (magic, index,
 *     size, the XXH64 of the decoded texels, and for capture a ysp_rt time,
 *     trial, event and camera time) and the data, each padded to 4096
 *     bytes, then the index (offset, size, flags, hash: 24 bytes per
 *     frame). Formats: the eight ysp/gfx.h texture formats, stored as
 *     ysp/gfx.h takes them (R16F and RGBA16F as float, rounded to half by
 *     the GPU), and I420 and NV12. RAW frames, or QOI for RGBA8 (lossless,
 *     coded by the header's own QOI, bit-equal with the reference qoi.h).
 *     Every frame is a keyframe, so a seek is a read. The writer appends
 *     from one thread, writes the index and fixes the header at close.
 *
 *   DECODER EXTENSION (yvid_decoder; desc.backend YVID_BACKEND_CUSTOM)
 *     The backend owns its codec objects and reports its stream's own
 *     timestamps; the core owns the clock, the index, the checks, the
 *     slots, the schedule and the records. Every call comes from the
 *     decode thread, never two at once. next() decodes the next frame in
 *     presentation order into the caller's planes (dst NULL: decode and
 *     discard), or lends its own planes (YVID_OUT_BORROWED), and returns
 *     0, YVID_ENDED, YVID_PENDING (nothing now; call again later) or a
 *     negative code. seek(key) positions it so the next next() returns the
 *     keyframe `key`. The core maps out.pts to a frame index as
 *     round(pts * num / (den * timescale)), or takes out.index when the
 *     backend knows it.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Links what ysp/gfx.h links. On Windows, Media Foundation (mfplat.dll,
 *   mfreadwrite.dll) and, for DXVA, d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll are loaded at
 *   run time and its GUIDs are copies in this file
 *   (tests/compile/video_com.cpp checks them against the SDK), so no
 *   import library and no mfuuid.lib is needed; YVID_NO_MF leaves it
 *   out. Windows Server needs its Media Foundation feature installed; open()
 *   says so when the DLLs are missing. pl_mpeg.h on the include path, or
 *   YVID_NO_PL_MPEG. Its implementation is compiled here unless
 *   YVID_PL_MPEG_EXTERNAL (then yvid_index_make() and the reader
 *   source are not available for MPEG-1). Its heap calls go through
 *   YVID_MALLOC, YVID_REALLOC and YVID_FREE (default: the C
 *   library's), which yvid_heap_calls() counts. YRT_NO_THREADS forces
 *   desc.inline_decode, and so does a decode thread that cannot start (wasm
 *   built without -pthread): the movie plays, each decode inside
 *   yvid_update() on the frame thread, and yvid_describe() says so.
 *   Define YVID_API to change the linkage.
