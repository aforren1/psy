/* ysp/timeline.h - v0.4.0 - public domain single-header timeline library
 *
 *   What a frame shows, as a function of when the frame appears. Events
 *   (onsets, offsets, value changes, triggers, annotations) at times on a
 *   chosen time base, keyframe tracks with easing on float channels
 *   (position, contrast, opacity, spatial frequency), and one call per frame
 *   that takes the PREDICTED ONSET of the frame being drawn, fills the
 *   channel values for it and reports which events landed on it, with the
 *   frame and the residual. It never reads a clock.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no OS calls, no threads, no heap, no I/O. Needs nothing
 *   but the C standard library (<math.h> for the cosine and log easings,
 *   snprintf for the open() message). It does not include ysp/rt.h: a time
 *   is an int64_t count of nanoseconds, the unit yrt_now_ns() returns, so
 *   the caller passes ysp/rt.h times in with a cast and nothing else.
 *
 *   Targets every platform the compiler does. C99 is the floor: it builds as
 *   C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default.

 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.4.0 - base rates: ytl_rate(tl, base, rt, num, den) runs a base at
 *          an exact rational rate from RT time rt on, with no jump and no
 *          rewind (GSAP's timeScale); ytl_get_rate(); ytl_rt_time(),
 *          the first RT time at which a running base reaches a base time.
 *          ytl_window(): the base time a frame's window reaches, the
 *          rule evaluate uses, for a scheduler or ysp/video.h. A time at
 *          or past +-2^62 is clamped only with a record: ytl_clamped()
 *          counts the evaluates and pauses that met one, and the queries
 *          refuse it (before, the sum could overflow). The report is
 *          ordered by when the base reaches each event, which is v0.3.0's
 *          onset - residual at rate 1. A timeline that sets no rate gives
 *          the same bytes as v0.3.0.
 *          Sequences: ytl_seq, a cursor on a base for building a trial
 *          in the order it plays, as a GSAP timeline is built (ytl_on,
 *          ytl_off, ytl_set_value, ytl_trigger, ytl_mark,
 *          ytl_wait, ytl_at, ytl_to, ytl_then, ytl_keyframes,
 *          ytl_on_n), with a sticky error; op tables (ytl_op, the
 *          YTL_ON() ... macros) applied all or none by ytl_run() and
 *          checked at load by ytl_check_ops(); ytl_seq_cancel(). A
 *          sequence's tweens on a channel become one keyed track in a key
 *          arena (desc.keys), so a channel takes any number of them and a
 *          rewind replays them. Every key of a track now reads its curve
 *          through one path (ytl_sample() is unchanged).
 *   v0.3.0 - ytl_skip(): a seek that marks the events it passes over
 *          YTL_EV_SKIPPED instead of firing them late on one frame, and
 *          returns how many; their channel values still apply. A skip
 *          back is an anchor's rewind. ytl_peek(): the pending events
 *          in an RT window, with their RT times, changing nothing, for
 *          the audio path's look-ahead. ytl_lead(): the lead in use.
 *          A rewind now makes skipped events pending again, and prune
 *          deletes skipped events with the fired ones. Nothing else
 *          changes: a timeline that never skips gives the same bytes as
 *          v0.2.0.
 *   v0.2.0 - tracks grow: ytl_track with a keyed or a SAMPLED form
 *          (floats at an integer rate, LINEAR, STEP or Catmull-Rom CUBIC,
 *          for long trajectories such as a sum-of-sines target), a REPEAT
 *          (period and count, for flicker and counterphase), the
 *          YTL_EASE_BEZIER easing (CSS cubic-bezier, from a per-track
 *          curve table), and ytl_tween() with a ytl_tween_desc: to,
 *          from, duration, start or delay, ease, cycles, yoyo, and
 *          keep_velocity (a Hermite takeover with no velocity step); a
 *          tween waits until its start while the old track runs on, and
 *          takes the old track's value there; its keys live in the
 *          handle. YTL_S() and YTL_MS() for literals. A STEP track is
 *          read at the end of the lead window, so its changes land where
 *          events at the same times land; other tracks are read at the
 *          onset. Breaking: the default lead is now half a frame (desc.lead
 *          0 means 0.5), and YTL_LEAD_NONE asks for the old never-early
 *          rule, because under onset noise never-early misplaced about
 *          12% of frame-aligned changes;
 *          ytl_sample() takes a ytl_track; ytl_key's reserved bytes
 *          are now reserved_ (1) and curve (2), so a key written as
 *          { time, value, ease } still compiles.
 *   v0.1.0 - first implementation: time bases with anchor, pause, resume
 *          and rewind (by anchor only); events in a caller-sized array;
 *          keyframe tracks with six easings; evaluate at the predicted
 *          onset with a lead window; late events by the base's reach;
 *          prune, remove and clear; the record of where every event
 *          landed.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.4.0. Rates and the window, tested by the writer of the
 *   implementation against an exact reference written apart from the
 *   header's arithmetic (32-bit limbs, itself checked against __int128):
 *   200,000 random cases of the mapping and its inverse to +-2^62; rate
 *   grids at 60 to 1000 Hz, six rates, three leads; the change point swept
 *   across a frame at 500 and 1000 Hz (208,000 landings); directed checks
 *   of every RATE rule and clamp; 12 more model runs with rate, window and
 *   rt_time ops; replay. The v0.3.0 test passes unchanged, its 20 model
 *   runs give the same statistics, and the examples print the same bytes
 *   but the version. 9 model mutations of RATE are caught; of 24 header
 *   mutations, 21 are caught and 3 cannot change a result
 *   (docs/timeline.md). MinGW gcc 16.1 (C99, C11, C++17), gcc 11.4
 *   under WSL2 (ASan, UBSan, -O3), MSVC 19.44 (C, C11, C++17). An
 *   evaluate with 7 bases at rate 1 costs 37 to 40 ns against v0.3.0's 26
 *   to 43; a scaled base adds about 4 to 5 ns.
 *   Sequences, also by the writer of the implementation: the rig_spec
 *   4.5.1 trial by calls and as a table (both ramps against a keyed
 *   reference on every frame, a re-anchor replaying them bit for bit);
 *   every ytl_run refusal with the handle, storage and arena unchanged
 *   by memcmp and the same code and index from ytl_check_ops; one
 *   sequence tween against ytl_tween() on 400 random descs, the same
 *   bits; cancel, on_n, the cross-base stop, the arena under clears; and
 *   600 random tables built by the calls, by ytl_run and by hand with
 *   ytl_add and ytl_set_track, compared on 160 frames. 19 of 19
 *   header mutations of the sequence code are caught. The op macros
 *   compile as C99 and as C++20 (tests/compile/timeline_ops.cpp). 32
 *   keyed channels sample within this machine's run-to-run spread of
 *   v0.3.0 (docs/timeline.md, "Sequences").
 *   v0.3.0. Skip, peek and lead: tests/adapt/timeline_test.c
 *   has directed checks for each (the 30-minute seek against an anchor,
 *   skip back against an anchor back, a waiting late event, the reach and
 *   rewind after a skip, prune and remove of skipped events, tracks and a
 *   waiting tween, peek's window edges, order, cap, bases and purity by
 *   memcmp of the whole handle, and a 22 s audio look-ahead at 60 Hz), and
 *   skip and peek are ops of 10 more seeds of the random model check.
 *   Unlike the v0.1 and v0.2 checks, these were written by the writer of
 *   the implementation. Ten model mutations of skip and peek are each
 *   caught; of 23 mutations of the header, 20 are caught and 3 cannot
 *   change a result (docs/timeline.md). The v0.2.0 test, unchanged,
 *   passes with the same model counts, and the examples print the same
 *   bytes but the version. Built and run with gcc 11.4 (WSL2: C99, C11,
 *   C++17, ASan and UBSan), MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 (C99, C11, C++17), MSVC
 *   19.44 (default C, C11, C++17) and emcc 6.0.10 under node.
 *   timeline_bench at 60 Hz (gcc): trial 51 ns, movie 322 ns mean and
 *   599 ns p99, script 60 ns, tracks 246 ns: inside v0.2.0's ranges.
 *   v0.2.0: Built and run on Linux (WSL2) with gcc 11.4 as C99
 *   and C11 under -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Werror at -O2 and
 *   -O3, and under -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all
 *   with no diagnostic; the compile checks also as C++17. On Windows 11
 *   with MSVC 19.44 under /W4 /WX, in its default C dialect and as
 *   /std:c++17. examples/timeline/trial.c and timeline_tracking.c print
 *   the same bytes on both compilers.
 *   tests/adapt/timeline_test.c was written from this manual by
 *   writers who did not read the implementation, with its own model, and
 *   checks: every rejected desc and argument; quantization on grids of 60,
 *   144, 240, 360, 500 and 1000 Hz at lead 0, 0.25 and 0.5 against a
 *   ceiling-division model with times on the window edges, and period 0;
 *   base states, pause with a lead, base 0 refusals; channel values by
 *   (time, id), binding and YTL_ERR_BOUND, add_n all or none; the
 *   report's order, cap and total; late events and the reach; anchor
 *   rewinds; remove, prune and clear; next_due. Tracks: every easing
 *   against its own formulas, BEZIER against a bisection solver on ten
 *   curves; sampled placement over 600k samples at rates 1, 7, 60, 120,
 *   999983 and 1e9 in integer arithmetic, LINEAR, STEP and CUBIC with the
 *   phantom ends; REPEAT folding and the hold; the 7.5 Hz flicker against
 *   the frame count at 60 to 500 Hz under onset noise; every
 *   set_track and tween rejection alone; tweens: every desc field and
 *   default, YTL_S and YTL_MS, "now" after evaluates, anchors, pauses
 *   and resumes, the takeover's from at the start for keyed, sampled,
 *   repeating, tween and Hermite old tracks, identical across seven frame
 *   grids, no repeated position on a retarget, keep_velocity's value and
 *   slope continuity against a Hermite model, cycles, FOREVER and yoyo,
 *   cancellation, replacement, the cross-base stop; a STEP track's change landing on
 *   the same frame as an event at the same time over 300 random cases;
 *   replay of the calls into two handles, storages compared with memcmp;
 *   and a random model check, 10 seeds x 800 steps with set_track and
 *   tweens that wait and take over, comparing the whole storage and every
 *   value after each step.
 *   Deliberate mutations of the model (lead off by one, rewind bounds, the
 *   LATE flag, an evaluate-time un-fire, repeated instead of phantom end
 *   samples, a whole-ns sample step, the hold a cycle late or folded, the
 *   Bezier parameter used as x, STEP tracks read at the onset, a tween's
 *   from read at the call, keep_velocity's slope ignored, the yoyo
 *   return leg missing) are each caught, and so is the first version's
 *   rule for "now". examples/timeline/tracking.c runs a 10-minute 5 Hz
 *   sum-of-sines target at 500 Hz within 1.73e-5 of its peak and a 7.5 Hz
 *   flicker with no wrong frame in 300500. examples/timeline/bench.c
 *   measures a frame's evaluate at 46-527 ns mean and under 1.6 us p99 on
 *   the workloads docs/timeline.md lists, the same at 60, 500 and
 *   1000 Hz; at 500 Hz the worst p99 is 0.04% of the 2 ms budget. Rare
 *   slow frames (up to 1.4 ms at 500 Hz) are the machine's, not the
 *   header's: two identical timelines timed in lockstep are slow on
 *   different frames (docs/timeline.md). What is NOT done: no run on
 *   macOS, clang, the newer gcc of CI or under emscripten (CI covers
 *   those); nothing here is a timing measurement of a display: the header
 *   computes, ysp/screen.h and the photodiode measure.

 *
 *   Compound literals and designated initializers are C99; in C++17 fill a
 *   ytl_tween_desc d = {} field by field.
 *
 *   The next trial clears the trial base and adds its own events, or keeps
 *   them and anchors the base again at its first frame: anchoring moves
 *   the base's time back to 0, which un-fires everything, so the same
 *   events run again (REWIND).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TIME
 *     Every time is an int64_t count of nanoseconds. The RT clock is the
 *     caller's monotonic clock, yrt_now_ns() when ysp/rt.h is in use; a
 *     frame's onset is on it. The header compares and subtracts times and
 *     never reads a clock. Times stay below 2^62 ns (146 years) in
 *     magnitude so that a sum of two cannot overflow. ytl_ns(seconds)
 *     rounds a double to the nearest nanosecond, for tables in seconds.
 *
 *   TIME BASES (ytl_anchor, ytl_pause, ytl_resume, ytl_stop)
 *     An event or a track is on one of YTL_MAX_BASES (8) bases. Base 0,
 *     YTL_BASE_RT, is the RT clock itself and always runs (anchor, pause,
 *     resume and stop on it are YTL_ERR_ARG). Bases 1 to 7
 *     are the caller's: a trial clock, a movie clock, a block clock. Each
 *     is in one of three states:
 *       stopped   the state after open(). Nothing on it fires, rewinds or
 *                 writes a channel; its channels hold their values.
 *       running   ytl_anchor(tl, b, rt, bt): base time bt at RT time rt,
 *                 advancing at the base's rate num/den (RATE; 1/1 unless
 *                 ytl_rate() set another), so base time at RT time t is
 *                 bt + floor((t - rt) x num / den), bt + (t - rt) at rate
 *                 1. rt may be in the future.
 *       paused    ytl_pause(tl, b, rt): the base time at rt, frozen.
 *                 ytl_resume(tl, b, rt) runs it again from that time at
 *                 RT time rt. A paused base evaluates at its frozen time,
 *                 so its tracks hold and an event added at or before that
 *                 time still fires. A pause un-fires nothing, even when
 *                 the frozen time is before an event that a lead window
 *                 already fired (QUANTIZATION).
 *     ytl_stop(tl, b) stops a base. Anchoring a base again, from any
 *     state, is how a trial clock restarts and how a movie seeks: forward,
 *     the next evaluate fires the events the base passed over, late by
 *     their residuals; back, the events from the new time on are pending
 *     again (REWIND). ytl_skip() is the seek that does not fire what it
 *     passes over (SKIP). ytl_rate() sets the rate (RATE); anchor, skip,
 *     pause, resume, stop and clear keep it.
 *
 *   EVENTS (ytl_event, ytl_add, ytl_add_n)
 *     An event has a time on its base, a kind, and the caller's payload:
 *       YTL_MARK     reported only; an annotation, a coroutine to resume
 *       YTL_TRIGGER  reported only; `code` is the value for the port
 *       YTL_ONSET    channel `target` becomes 1 when it fires
 *       YTL_OFFSET   channel `target` becomes 0
 *       YTL_SET      channel `target` becomes `value`
 *       YTL_KIND_USER (16) to 255: reported only, the caller's meaning
 *     A zeroed event is a MARK at time 0 on the RT base. `code`, `user` and
 *     (for the reported-only kinds) `target` are the caller's and come back
 *     unchanged in the report. Kinds 5 to 15 are reserved and rejected.
 *     ytl_add() copies the event into the storage the desc gave, pending
 *     (flags 0, frame -1, onset 0, residual 0), assigns it an id (0, 1, 2, ... in add order; ytl_open() restarts it) and
 *     returns the id. ytl_add_n() adds n events, all or none, and returns
 *     the first id; the others follow in order. The storage is kept sorted
 *     by base, then time, then id, so events at one time keep their add
 *     order. An add costs a binary search and a move of the events after
 *     it in the storage: appending sorted events to the last base in use
 *     moves nothing, so a table of thousands loads in linear time.
 *
 *   CHANNELS (ytl_values, desc.n_channels, desc.initial)
 *     The state of a frame is desc.n_channels floats (at most
 *     YTL_MAX_CHANNELS, 256 by default), starting at desc.initial[] (all
 *     0 when NULL). The caller decides what each one means. A channel is
 *     driven either by events (ONSET, OFFSET, SET naming it) or by a track
 *     (ytl_set_track, ytl_set_keys, ytl_tween), never both, and from
 *     one base only. The first event that names a free channel binds it to
 *     the event's base; an event on another base, or a track, is then
 *     YTL_ERR_BOUND until the channel's last event is gone. A track binds
 *     the channel to its base and replaces the channel's track whatever
 *     base it was on; an event naming it is YTL_ERR_BOUND until the
 *     track is removed (set_track with NULL, set_keys with n = 0).
 *     ytl_clear() of a base frees the channels bound to it. A channel a
 *     prune left with no event is free but keeps its value, and a clear
 *     does not touch it.
 *     An event-driven channel's value is the value of its fired or skipped
 *     (SKIP) event with the latest (time, id), or its initial value when
 *     there is none. So an event that fires late (LATE EVENTS) does not
 *     overwrite a later event that fired before it, a skip leaves the
 *     channel as playing through would, and a rewind recomputes the
 *     channel from the events still fired or skipped.
 *
 *   TRACKS (ytl_track, ytl_set_track, ytl_set_keys, ytl_tween,
 *           ytl_sample)
 *     A track drives a channel from a function of its base's time. It has
 *     one of two forms, and an optional repeat.
 *     KEYED: n_keys keys (ytl_key) sorted by time, equal times allowed
 *     (a jump). For movement and envelopes with few changes: a ramp, a
 *     fade, a path through a dozen points. The value at time t: the first
 *     key's value before it, the last key's value from it on, and between
 *     key i and key i+1 (t_i <= t < t_i+1, at equal times the later key)
 *     v_i + (v_i+1 - v_i) e(u) with key i's easing e at
 *     u = (t - t_i) / (t_i+1 - t_i):
 *       YTL_EASE_LINEAR  (0)   e = u
 *       YTL_EASE_STEP          e = 0: v_i until t_i+1
 *       YTL_EASE_COSINE        e = (1 - cos(pi u)) / 2, a raised cosine
 *       YTL_EASE_QUAD_IN       e = u^2, starts slow
 *       YTL_EASE_QUAD_OUT      e = 1 - (1 - u)^2, ends slow
 *       YTL_EASE_BEZIER        e = y where x = u on the cubic Bezier
 *                                curve from (0, 0) to (1, 1) with control
 *                                points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), CSS's
 *                                cubic-bezier(), from track.curves[key.curve]
 *       YTL_EASE_LOG           not of that form: v_i (v_i+1 / v_i)^u, a
 *                                geometric sweep (spatial frequency, tone
 *                                frequency); both values must be > 0
 *     A curve's x1 and x2 are in [0, 1], so x rises with the curve
 *     parameter and u has one y. y1 and y2 may leave [0, 1], and then the
 *     value overshoots its keys; for a stimulus that is usually a confound.
 *     The y is found to 1e-12 in x. Every key's ease must be a
 *     ytl_ease, the last key's too, though the last key's is never used
 *     and the LOG and BEZIER checks skip it.
 *     SAMPLED: n_samples floats at track.rate samples per second (an
 *     integer, 1 to 1e9), sample i at base time t0 + i * 1e9 / rate ns,
 *     exactly, not rounded to a whole ns. For a trajectory that few keys
 *     cannot describe: a sum-of-sines tracking target, a recorded path, a
 *     noise sequence. A sample costs 4 bytes against a key's 16, there is
 *     no time column to search, and the lookup is integer arithmetic, so a
 *     table does not drift over hours. A rate that is not an integer
 *     (59.94) is a resampling job for the pack tool. A step in whole ns
 *     would drift: at 120 samples/s it is a third of a ns short per
 *     sample, and docs/timeline.md measures what that costs on a
 *     moving target. Before t0 the value is the first sample, from the last
 *     sample's time on the last sample, and between samples i and i+1
 *     by track.interp:
 *       YTL_INTERP_LINEAR (0)  v_i + (v_i+1 - v_i) u
 *       YTL_INTERP_STEP        v_i
 *       YTL_INTERP_CUBIC       Catmull-Rom through v_i-1 .. v_i+2, with
 *                                v_-1 = 2 v_0 - v_1 and v_n = 2 v_n-1 -
 *                                v_n-2 past the ends; passes through every
 *                                sample with a continuous velocity, and
 *                                with two samples is LINEAR
 *     with u the fraction of the way from sample i's time to sample
 *     i+1's. How fine a table needs to be is
 *     measured in docs/timeline.md: for a sum of sines up to 5 Hz,
 *     CUBIC at 120 samples/s stays within 7.4e-6 of the peak, 1.7e-5 in
 *     the first and last segment (0.29 MB for 10 minutes), and reaches
 *     float rounding at 500 samples/s in the interior; LINEAR
 *     needs 1000 samples/s for 5e-6, and its velocity steps at every
 *     sample. The pack tool computes the samples once, so the runtime does
 *     no trigonometry and the trajectory is the same bits everywhere.
 *     REPEAT: track.period > 0 repeats the track every period ns from its
 *     start (the first key's time, or t0): base time t reads the track at
 *     start + ((t - start) mod period). track.repeats cycles (0: forever),
 *     after which the track holds its value at start + period, read
 *     without repeating. Before the start, no repeat applies. A square-wave
 *     flicker is two STEP keys and a period; a key past start + period is
 *     never reached while the track repeats.
 *     ytl_set_track(tl, channel, base, &tr) copies the struct; the
 *     arrays it points at (keys, curves, samples) stay the caller's and
 *     must stay valid and unchanged until the channel's track is
 *     replaced, the base is cleared, or the handle is no longer used. A
 *     pack's table works as is. tr NULL removes the track and returns the
 *     channel to its initial value. ytl_set_keys(tl, channel, base,
 *     keys, n) is set_track with only keys and n (n = 0 removes).
 *     set_track rejects with YTL_ERR_ARG: neither form or both; a
 *     negative count; unsorted key times; a key ease that is not a
 *     ytl_ease; a non-finite key value, sample or curve y; a curve x
 *     outside [0, 1]; a BEZIER key whose curve index is not below
 *     n_curves, or a LOG key with a value <= 0 at either end (both but
 *     the last key); n_curves > 0 with curves NULL, and any curve in the
 *     table that is bad, used or not; keys set with n_keys 0, or samples
 *     with n_samples 0 (neither form); a rate outside 1 to 1e9; a last
 *     sample at or past 2^62 (its time rounded up to a whole ns); an
 *     interp that is not a ytl_interp; a period < 0 or >= 2^62;
 *     repeats < 0, or > 0 with period 0; a time at or past +-2^62. The
 *     check reads every key and sample once. A rejected call leaves the
 *     channel's track as it was.
 *     TWEENS: ytl_tween(tl, channel, base, &d) drives a channel from one
 *     value to another, with its keys in the handle, so the caller keeps no
 *     array alive. Every field of ytl_tween_desc may be left zero:
 *       to             the end value
 *       duration       ns, >= 0; 0 jumps at the start
 *       start          the base time it starts, when start_set; otherwise
 *                      "now": the base time of the base's last evaluated
 *                      onset, unless an anchor, pause, resume or rate
 *                      change of a running base came after it, which set
 *                      "now" to the anchor's base time, the frozen time or
 *                      the base time at the change; 0 on a base never
 *                      evaluated or anchored
 *       delay          added to the start either way, so {.delay = d} is
 *                      "d after now" and {.start = t, .start_set = true,
 *                      .delay = d} is "d after t"
 *       from           the start value, when from_set; otherwise the value
 *                      the channel has at the start (below)
 *       ease, curve    a ytl_ease (0 = LINEAR), and for YTL_EASE_BEZIER
 *                      the curve, inline in the desc
 *       cycles         0 or 1: play once; n: n cycles; YTL_FOREVER. The
 *                      hold after the last cycle is as REPEAT gives it
 *       yoyo           a cycle goes from `from` to `to` and back, over
 *                      2 x duration, the return leg with the same ease
 *       keep_velocity  start at the velocity the channel has at the start
 *                      and come to rest at `to`: the shape is a cubic
 *                      Hermite segment, with no step in velocity, for a
 *                      moving target retargeted in mid-flight. With no
 *                      track at the start the velocity is 0, a smoothstep
 *     `from` is read only with from_set and `curve` only with BEZIER. The
 *     return leg of a yoyo applies the same ease again, from `to` to
 *     `from`; it is not GSAP's mirrored playback, so QUAD_IN is slow at
 *     the start of both legs.
 *     THE TAKEOVER. The tween waits until its start. Until then the
 *     channel's track runs on, as GSAP lets an overwritten tween run until
 *     the new one starts. At the start, the tween takes over the channel,
 *     and `from` (unless from_set) is the value the old track has at the
 *     start time, not at the frame that happens to see the start. So a
 *     tween posted just before a frame begins where the old motion would
 *     have been on that frame, with no repeated position, and the result
 *     does not depend on frame timing. With keep_velocity the start
 *     velocity is the old track's slope over the last microsecond before
 *     the start. A channel with no track starts from its value; a channel
 *     whose track is on another base stops that track at once, at its last
 *     value, because the two bases' times do not compare. A second tween
 *     before the first has started replaces it. ytl_set_track() on the
 *     channel cancels a waiting tween. A rewind does not undo a takeover:
 *     the takeover replaced the channel's track, which is not an event.
 *     Rejected with YTL_ERR_ARG: d NULL; a negative duration; a start,
 *     a delay, start + delay, or start + delay + duration (x 2 with yoyo)
 *     at or past +-2^62 (cycles do not count: a repeat folds time); a
 *     non-finite to, or from with from_set; an ease that is not a
 *     ytl_ease; a bad curve with BEZIER; LOG without from_set, or with
 *     from or to <= 0; cycles below YTL_FOREVER; more than one cycle, or
 *     yoyo, with duration 0; keep_velocity with an ease other than LINEAR,
 *     from_set, yoyo, more than one cycle (YTL_FOREVER included), or
 *     duration 0. A STEP tween is
 *     a STEP track (below). To await the end, add a MARK at start +
 *     duration (x 2 with yoyo, x cycles) on the same base.
 *     The arithmetic is double, stored as float. ytl_sample(&tr, t) is
 *     the same function without a handle, for a designer's preview, with
 *     no validation. A track writes its channel at every evaluate while
 *     its base runs or is paused, at the base time of the frame's onset:
 *     a ramp shows its value at the moment the frame appears. A STEP
 *     track is the exception. It is a sampled track with
 *     YTL_INTERP_STEP, or a keyed track (a tween included) whose keys
 *     but the last are all YTL_EASE_STEP. It changes value only at its
 *     key times, so it is read at the end of the frame's lead window, base
 *     time at (onset + lead x period), and each change lands on the frame
 *     an event at the same time would (QUANTIZATION). Under
 *     YTL_LEAD_NONE both are read at the onset. The reason is frame-locked flicker: a 7.5 Hz
 *     square wave on a 60 Hz display has its edges exactly on frame
 *     onsets, and an onset rounded to whole ns, or predicted with any
 *     noise, falls on either side of an edge. Read at the onset, a wave
 *     with exact edges showed the wrong state on 3000 of 36000 frames;
 *     read at the end of a half-period window, on none
 *     (docs/timeline.md). A jump inside a track that is not a STEP
 *     track (a STEP key among ramps, keys at equal times, the wrap of a
 *     repeat whose cycle does not end where it starts) is read at the
 *     onset; to quantize it like an event, put it on its own STEP track
 *     or make it an event. Each frame costs one key
 *     lookup (O(1) while time moves forward a key at a time, a binary
 *     search after a jump or a repeat's wrap) or one division, plus the
 *     easing: cos() for COSINE, exp() and log() for LOG, at most 68
 *     cubic evaluations for BEZIER (a few on ordinary curves).
 *
 *   EVALUATE (ytl_frame, ytl_evaluate)
 *     Once per frame, before drawing, with the frame's PREDICTED onset on
 *     the RT clock, the frame period and the caller's frame number:
 *       ytl_frame f = { onset_ns, period_ns, index };
 *       int n = ytl_evaluate(tl, &f, fired, cap);
 *     For each base that is not stopped, in base order: fire every event
 *     the frame's window reaches that has not fired, then write the base's
 *     tracks. An evaluate never un-fires an event; only an anchor does
 *     (REWIND). Returns the number of events fired.
 *     The first min(n, cap) of them, ordered by RT target time and then
 *     by id, are copied into fired[], landing fields
 *     included; the rest fired all the same and their records are in the
 *     storage (ytl_events). fired may be NULL with cap 0. Onsets must
 *     not decrease from one call to the next (YTL_ERR_ORDER); an equal
 *     onset is allowed and fires only what was added since. An evaluate
 *     changes nothing but the handle and the storage, and the same calls
 *     in the same order give the same bytes: that is REPLAY. An event's RT
 *     target is the RT time its base reaches it (ytl_rt_time) when the
 *     base runs, and onset - residual when it is paused; at rate 1 the two
 *     are equal. Across bases at different rates, onset - residual would
 *     order by lateness in base ns instead of by time.
 *
 *   QUANTIZATION (desc.lead, ytl_window)
 *     An event lands on the first evaluated frame whose window reaches its
 *     time: on its base, time <= base time at RT time (onset + lead x
 *     period), with lead x period truncated to whole nanoseconds. The lead
 *     is RT time at every base rate (RATE), so the event lands on the frame
 *     nearest to the RT time its base reaches it. ytl_window(tl, b, &f,
 *     &end) gives that window end without evaluating, for a scheduler that
 *     resumes waits by the same rule, or a header that places its own
 *     frames by it (ysp/video.h). desc.lead:
 *       0                the default, 0.5: the nearest frame, up to half a
 *                        period early. A frame-aligned time lands on its
 *                        frame however the onset was rounded or predicted.
 *       (0, 1)           that fraction of a period early at most.
 *       YTL_LEAD_NONE  never early: the first frame whose onset is at or
 *                        after the event.
 *     The default is half a frame because a predicted onset carries noise.
 *     With 2 us of noise on a 60 Hz display, never-early put about 12% of
 *     frame-aligned changes a frame late, and half a frame put none
 *     (docs/timeline.md). Use YTL_LEAD_NONE only when "not before"
 *     matters more than "on the right frame". A script's wait(dt) lands on
 *     the frame nearest its target under the default.
 *     ytl_lead(tl) gives the lead in use: 0.5 for a desc lead of 0, the
 *     desc's lead in (0, 1), and 0 for YTL_LEAD_NONE, so that a window
 *     ends lead x period after the onset in every case. A header that
 *     places its own frames by the same rule (ysp/video.h) reads it.
 *     Pass period 0 on a display with no fixed period (variable refresh),
 *     and lead does nothing. When it fires, the event records:
 *       frame     f.index of the frame it landed on
 *       onset     f.onset, the predicted onset of that frame
 *       residual  base time at f.onset minus the event's time: how late
 *                 (positive) or early (negative; never under
 *                 YTL_LEAD_NONE) the frame shows it, in base ns. On a
 *                 running base at rate 1 this equals onset minus the
 *                 event's RT time; at rate num/den the RT lateness is about
 *                 residual x den / num.
 *     The onset is a prediction. The flip record of the same frame number
 *     gives the measured one; the difference is the frame's error and
 *     applies to every event that landed on it.
 *     ytl_next_due(tl, &t) gives the earliest RT time of a pending event
 *     (not fired, not skipped) on a running base, for a display that can
 *     flip at a time, or for sleeping until there is something to do. An
 *     event that a slow base reaches only past 2^62 RT ns gives 2^62, a
 *     time no clock reaches.
 *
 *   LATE EVENTS
 *     A base's REACH is the furthest window end any evaluate has reached
 *     on it since it was last rewound (REWIND sets it to just before the
 *     anchor's time). An event added at or before the reach is late: it
 *     fires at the first evaluate whose window reaches it, normally the
 *     next one, with YTL_EV_LATE set and a residual that says how late.
 *     The flag is set when the event fires; a pending event's flags are
 *     0. A window can end behind the reach (a pause with a lead, an
 *     anchor whose RT time is after the onset); a late event past the
 *     window then waits for it.
 *     It is how a script's "now" lands: add the event at the current time
 *     on any base and the next frame carries it.
 *
 *   REWIND
 *     ytl_anchor(tl, b, rt, bt) with bt at or before the furthest base
 *     time of an onset evaluated on the base (or before the time of its
 *     last skip, SKIP) moves the base back: every fired or skipped event
 *     of the base at or after bt, the one exactly at bt included, becomes
 *     pending again. Its landing fields reset (frame -1, onset 0, residual
 *     0, flags 0), the base's event-driven channels are recomputed from
 *     the events still fired or skipped, and the events fire again when
 *     the base reaches them. The base's reach moves to just before bt.
 *     Running a trial's events twice is two anchors at base time 0.
 *     An anchor at a later bt rewinds nothing. Nothing else rewinds: an
 *     anchor at an earlier bt whose RT time is after the next onset puts
 *     that onset before bt, and the events from bt on wait for the base
 *     to reach them again, while the fired events before bt stay fired.
 *     A re-anchor that corrects a drift by moving a base back by a small
 *     amount re-fires what lies in that amount; to avoid it, correct
 *     forward only.
 *
 *   SKIP (ytl_skip)
 *     ytl_skip(tl, b, rt, bt) is a seek that does not fire what it
 *     passes over. It is ytl_anchor(tl, b, rt, bt), and then every
 *     event of the base before bt that is still pending is skipped: its
 *     flags become YTL_EV_SKIPPED, its frame stays -1, its onset
 *     becomes rt and its residual bt minus its time (how far before the
 *     seek's target it was). A skipped event never fires and is in no
 *     evaluate's report. The return value, the number skipped, is the
 *     report of the skip; the storage holds each one. After a skip no
 *     event of the base before bt is pending, and the event exactly at
 *     bt fires as usual on the frame that reaches it.
 *     Forward, an anchor fires on the next frame every event it passed
 *     over, late by its residual; a skip fires none. On a movie base with
 *     an annotation every second, a 30-minute seek fires 1800 events on
 *     one frame after an anchor and none after a skip.
 *     Back, a skip is the anchor's REWIND, and then the late events
 *     before bt still waiting for a window are skipped. A seek calls
 *     ytl_skip() whatever its direction; refusing a skip back would
 *     make every caller compare bt with a time it cannot read.
 *     What else it does:
 *       channels  a skipped ONSET, OFFSET or SET counts for its channel
 *                 as a fired one does (CHANNELS), so the channel shows
 *                 what playing through to bt would, with no report.
 *       tracks    nothing: a track is a function of base time, and the
 *                 next evaluate reads it at its onset's base time. A
 *                 tween waiting for a start before bt takes over at the
 *                 next evaluate, from the old track's value at its start,
 *                 as it would without the skip. "now" is bt, as after an
 *                 anchor.
 *       reach     when the base's reach is before bt, it moves to just
 *                 before bt, and so does the furthest base time of an
 *                 evaluated onset. So an event added later at a time
 *                 before bt is late (LATE EVENTS), and a later anchor back
 *                 to a time before bt makes the skipped events from there
 *                 pending again (REWIND).
 *       state     the base runs from bt at rt, as after an anchor. A seek
 *                 that stays paused is a skip and a ytl_pause() at the
 *                 same rt.
 *     A skip costs a binary search and a write per event it skips.
 *
 *   PEEK (ytl_peek)
 *     ytl_peek(tl, b, from_rt, to_rt, out, cap) lists the pending events
 *     of base b (or of every base, YTL_ALL_BASES) whose RT time is in
 *     [from_rt, to_rt), and changes nothing: no flag, landing, channel,
 *     reach or "now". An event's RT time is when its running base reaches
 *     its time, ytl_rt_time(): anchor_rt + ceil((time - anchor_bt) x den
 *     / num), anchor_rt + (time - anchor_bt) at rate 1. A
 *     paused or stopped base has no RT times and gives no event; a fired
 *     or skipped event is not pending. Returns how many events are in the
 *     window; the first min(that, cap) are copied into out[] ordered by
 *     RT time, then id, each with onset set to its RT time, residual 0,
 *     frame -1 and flags 0. So onset - residual is the RT time in a peek
 *     as in a report. out may be NULL with cap 0, to count.
 *     It is the look-ahead for sound. An evaluate fires an event on the
 *     frame that shows it, at most lead x period early, and ysp/audio.h
 *     needs an onset 43.5 to 54.5 ms before its time (docs/audio.md).
 *     The audio path peeks [last to_rt, now + its lead) each frame and
 *     schedules by id: half-open windows that follow each other neither
 *     overlap nor leave a gap. The event still fires on its frame, and
 *     its landing record is the frame's. An event added less than the
 *     audio lead before its time can be in no peek before its frame
 *     fires it; it is in that evaluate's report, and the caller plays it
 *     late from there. An anchor, skip, pause, resume or rate change moves
 *     the RT times, so peek again after one. The cost is a binary search per
 *     base and a read per event in the window.
 *
 *   RATE (ytl_rate, ytl_get_rate, ytl_rt_time, ytl_clamped)
 *     ytl_rate(tl, b, rt, num, den) runs base b (1 to 7) at num/den base
 *     ns per RT ns from RT time rt on: slow motion for a movie base at 1/2,
 *     a 24 to 23.976 fps conversion at 1000/1001. num and den are in
 *     [1, 2^31 - 1] and are stored reduced by their gcd, so equal rates
 *     are equal bytes. GSAP's movie.timeScale(0.5), anime.js's
 *     anim.speed = 0.5 and Motion's controls.speed = 0.5 are
 *       ytl_rate(&tl, MOVIE, next_onset, 1, 2);
 *     The JS calls read their ticker's clock; this header reads none, so
 *     the change point is an argument. Pass the predicted onset of the
 *     next frame you evaluate, or the RT time of a script's now().
 *     The arithmetic is exact, in integers:
 *       base time at RT t   bt(t) = anchor_bt + floor((t - anchor_rt) x
 *                           num / den)
 *       RT time of base T   rt(T) = anchor_rt + ceil((T - anchor_bt) x
 *                           den / num), ytl_rt_time()
 *     The two round in opposite directions, so the base has reached T at
 *     RT time t exactly when t >= rt(T): every rule that asks "has the
 *     base reached it" (the window, peek, next_due, the report's order)
 *     gives the same answer from either side. Each time is computed from
 *     the anchor, so a rate held for 10 hours is within 1 ns of the exact
 *     rational time, as after 1 s; a change takes one floor, so n changes
 *     leave the base behind the exact time by less than n + 1 ns, never
 *     ahead. Replay stays exact: integer operations only.
 *     What a change does:
 *       running   the base continues from its time at rt, bt(rt) under
 *                 the old rate, at the new rate: no jump, and no rewind.
 *                 It is not an anchor: an anchor at the last onset's base
 *                 time rewinds, and the event there would fire twice. The
 *                 reach and the fired events stay; when the next window
 *                 ends behind the reach (with lead 0.5 and rt at the last
 *                 onset, a drop of the rate by more than 3 times), nothing
 *                 un-fires and late events wait for it (LATE EVENTS).
 *                 "now" (TWEENS) becomes bt(rt). An rt before the last
 *                 onset or after the next one places the change there, as
 *                 an anchor places its rt.
 *       paused    the rate is kept for the resume; the frozen time and
 *                 "now" stay.
 *       stopped   the rate is kept for the next anchor.
 *       same rate nothing changes, not even "now".
 *     Anchor, skip, pause, resume, stop and clear keep the rate; open()
 *     sets 1/1 on every base. Base 0 is always 1/1.
 *     What runs at the rate: everything on the base is in base time, and
 *     the lead stays RT ns. A track is a function of base time, so it
 *     plays at the rate; a sampled track stays exact. A repeat runs at its
 *     rate x num/den in RT, so a flicker defined in display frames belongs
 *     on a base at rate 1. A tween's duration, delay and start are base
 *     time: a 200 ms tween at 1/2 takes 400 ms of RT, as a GSAP tween in a
 *     timeline with timeScale(0.5) does. keep_velocity takes the slope per
 *     base ns, so a change during a tween steps its RT velocity by the
 *     ratio of the rates. A residual is base ns.
 *     Refused with YTL_ERR_ARG: rate 0 (ytl_pause() is the one way to
 *     freeze a base; at 0 the RT time of a base time does not exist) and a
 *     negative rate (base time that goes back conflicts with "an evaluate
 *     never un-fires"; a reverse scrub is a series of ytl_skip() calls,
 *     each a recorded rewind).
 *     Range: times stay below 2^62 in magnitude (TIME). The products are
 *     split so that nothing overflows for any rate, and a base time at or
 *     past +-2^62 (rate 1000/1 held for 53 days, or an anchor near the
 *     limit) becomes +-2^62, which no event time equals, so every event
 *     still fires or waits as the exact time says. The clamp is never
 *     silent: ytl_clamped(tl, b) counts the evaluates and pauses that
 *     met one; ytl_base_time(), ytl_rt_time() and ytl_window()
 *     return false for such a time; ytl_rate() refuses a running base
 *     whose time at rt is out of range.
 *     Cost: at rate 1, one compare more per conversion than v0.3.0. A
 *     scaled base adds two 64-bit divisions per conversion, and an
 *     evaluate does two conversions per base (docs/timeline.md).
 *
 *   SEQUENCES (ytl_seq, ytl_op, desc.keys)
 *     A sequence is a cursor on one base, in base time, for writing a trial
 *     in the order it plays. ytl_seq_on(tl, b) puts the cursor at 0,
 *     ytl_seq_now(tl, b) at the base's "now" (TWEENS). Against GSAP:
 *       ytl_on, ytl_off, ytl_set_value   .set(): ONSET, OFFSET or SET
 *                                              of a channel at the cursor
 *       ytl_trigger, ytl_mark(q, code, user)  .call(): a TRIGGER or a
 *                                              MARK at the cursor
 *       ytl_wait(q, dt), ytl_at(q, t)      "+=dt" and an absolute
 *                                              position; q.t is the cursor,
 *                                              so a variable is a label
 *       ytl_to(q, ch, &d)                    .to(target, vars, "<"): a
 *                                              tween from the cursor plus
 *                                              d.delay; the cursor stays;
 *                                              returns the tween's end
 *       ytl_then(q, ch, &d)                  .to(target, vars): ytl_to
 *                                              and a wait to its end
 *       ytl_keyframes(q, ch, v, dt, n, ease) keyframes: v[i] at the cursor
 *                                              + dt[i], rising, from >= 0
 *       ytl_on_n(q, chans, n, stagger)       stagger: ONSET on chans[i] at
 *                                              the cursor + i x stagger, all
 *                                              or none
 *     Nothing here changes timing: each call lowers to events and keys at
 *     absolute base times, and frame placement, sampling and replay are the
 *     core's.
 *     A STICKY ERROR, as in a stream: the first failing call stores its code
 *     in q.err and its index (calls counted from 0) in q.err_call, and every
 *     later call does nothing. One check at the end of a sequence does. The
 *     builder is not atomic: the calls before the error stay. Clear the
 *     base after an error, as a trial does anyway, or cancel the sequence.
 *     ytl_seq_cancel(&q) deletes every event of the sequence's base with
 *     an id at or past the sequence's first and the blocks the sequence
 *     built, and returns how many events. Ids rise in add order; the
 *     storage is sorted by time, so it cannot be cut at a mark. So events
 *     that other code added to the same base after the sequence began go
 *     too. A block that an evaluate already took over is removed and its
 *     channel holds its value; the track or tween it replaced is not
 *     brought back. After a cancel the sequence does nothing more.
 *     TWEENS IN A SEQUENCE: all the tweens of one sequence on a channel
 *     become one keyed track in the KEY ARENA, a block of keys grown with
 *     each call: a key at the start and at the end of each segment (cycles
 *     and yoyo unrolled), and between segments the value holds. The block
 *     waits for its first start while the channel's old driver runs, and
 *     then takes over from the old driver's value (and with keep_velocity
 *     its slope) at that start, as ytl_tween() does. From then on it is an
 *     ordinary keyed track, a function of base time: re-anchoring a trial
 *     at 0 replays its tweens exactly. A later tween's `from`, when not set,
 *     is the value where the block ends. A sequence of one tween gives the
 *     same values, bit for bit, as ytl_tween() with the same desc.
 *     Rejected in a sequence with YTL_ERR_ARG, besides ytl_tween()'s own
 *     checks: start_set (the cursor is the start; two sources for it would
 *     be silent), YTL_FOREVER (a repeat folds a whole track, not a
 *     segment; use ytl_set_track with a repeat), a tween that starts
 *     before the end of the channel's previous one in the sequence (cutting
 *     an eased segment part way changes its shape), and keep_velocity on
 *     any but the channel's first tween in the sequence (its slope is the
 *     takeover's). ytl_keyframes takes no BEZIER (it has no curve).
 *     THE KEY ARENA is desc.keys, desc.key_capacity entries of 16 bytes,
 *     the caller's, used while the handle is. With none, a sequence tween
 *     is YTL_ERR_FULL; events need no arena. Each channel's block is a
 *     header slot, its keys and its curve slots, and the channel stores an
 *     offset, not a pointer. A block that is replaced (a new sequence on the
 *     channel, set_track, a tween, a clear of its base) is garbage until a
 *     call needs its room: then the arena is compacted in one pass, and
 *     offsets move with the blocks. An evaluate never compacts or allocates.
 *     A call that does not fit after a compaction is YTL_ERR_FULL and
 *     adds nothing: a track is never cut short. A tween on a block at the
 *     top of the arena grows it in place; on another block it copies the
 *     block to the top, so building several channels at once can need room
 *     for one more copy of the largest block.
 *     OP TABLES: a ytl_op is one call as data, 96 bytes, built with
 *       YTL_ON(ch) YTL_OFF(ch) YTL_SET_VALUE(ch, v) YTL_TRIGGER(code)
 *       YTL_MARK(code, user) YTL_WAIT(dt) YTL_AT(t)
 *       YTL_TO(ch, desc fields...) YTL_THEN(ch, desc fields...)
 *     which are designated initializers: C99, or C++20 in the fields' order
 *     (g++ wants -Wno-missing-field-initializers). A table can be static
 *     const, logged and compared. ytl_run(&q, ops, n) is all or none: it
 *     checks the whole table first, from the sequence's cursor and blocks,
 *     and on an error sets q.err and q.err_call (the op's index) and
 *     changes nothing; then it applies the ops as the calls would.
 *     ytl_check_ops(tl, b, ops, n, &bad) is that check alone, for a new
 *     sequence at 0, changing nothing: for a pack's table when it loads,
 *     not at trial 190. It checks each op's fields, binding (an op against
 *     the first earlier op naming its channel, else the channel's state:
 *     O(n^2) compares, once), the overlap rule, the event storage, and the
 *     arena with room for one more copy of the largest block, so a table
 *     that passes cannot run out of room part way. What it cannot know is
 *     the run-time takeover value.
 *
 *   REMOVING (ytl_remove, ytl_prune, ytl_clear)
 *     ytl_remove(tl, id) deletes one event; when it had fired and its
 *     channel showed its value, the channel is recomputed.
 *     ytl_prune(tl, base) deletes every fired or skipped event of a base
 *     (YTL_ALL_BASES for all): for a long session on the RT base, where
 *     a script adds waits forever and the caller has logged the reports.
 *     Channels keep their values; a channel left with no events is free,
 *     and a later rewind of the base recomputes from what remains.
 *     ytl_clear(tl, base) deletes every event of a base and the keys of
 *     every channel bound to it, returns those channels to their initial
 *     values and frees them. The base keeps its state and anchor. Ids are
 *     never reused before the next open().
 *
 *   REPLAY
 *     A timeline is a function of the calls made on it. The same open(),
 *     the same adds, anchors and keys, and the same frames (onset, period,
 *     index) produce the same values, the same reports and the same
 *     storage bytes, every time and on every thread. The storage is the
 *     record of where every event landed. Two builds agree on every event
 *     field bit for bit (integer arithmetic) and on track values to the
 *     libm in use: COSINE and LOG call cos(), exp() and log(), whose last
 *     bit may differ between C libraries. The other easings, BEZIER, and
 *     the sampled interpolations are +, -, * and / in double, exact under
 *     IEEE 754 unless the compiler contracts them into fused multiply-adds
 *     (-ffp-contract=fast, or /fp:fast). So a trajectory the pack tool
 *     computed is the same bits on every platform; the same trajectory
 *     computed at run time with sin() would not be.
 *
 *   WITH ysp/trials.h
 *     The trial handler picks the condition, the caller turns it into
 *     events and keys on a trial base, anchors the base at the trial's
 *     first frame, and the timeline runs it. Nothing links the two
 *     headers. At movie scale, the storage holds thousands of annotations
 *     on a movie base, anchored, paused and skipped with the player.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The handle is about 64 KB at the default YTL_MAX_CHANNELS (256),
 *   almost all of it 248 bytes per channel: a copy of its track, a
 *   tween's three keys and curve, and a waiting tween's desc. An evaluate
 *   reads a byte per channel to
 *   find the tracked ones and touches only their records. Define
 *   YTL_MAX_CHANNELS (1 to 65535) before the implementation and every
 *   include to change it. Events live in the storage the desc gives
 *   (desc.events, desc.event_capacity entries of 64 bytes), owned by the
 *   caller and used while the handle is. Keys, curves and samples are the
 *   caller's arrays. A sequence's tweens live in the key arena the desc
 *   gives (desc.keys, 16 bytes a slot). Nothing is allocated.
 *   A frame's cost is a binary search per base that is not stopped, the
 *   events that fire (each a copy, plus an insertion into the report),
 *   and one key lookup per keyed channel, which is O(1) while time moves
 *   forward a segment at a time. Nothing depends on the refresh rate:
 *   the period is an argument, times are whole nanoseconds, and a faster
 *   display only moves the key cache less per frame. The per-frame cost
 *   measured the same at 60, 500 and 1000 Hz (docs/timeline.md), so
 *   the share of the budget grows with the rate and nothing else does.
 *   examples/timeline/bench.c [refresh_hz] measures it.
 *   No function is safe to call on one handle from two threads at once.
 *   The intended use is the frame thread only.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Link libm on Linux (-lm). Define YTL_API to change the linkage of
 *   every function (for example `static`); with `static`, a translation
 *   unit that does not call every function needs -Wno-unused-function.
