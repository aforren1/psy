/* ysp/audio.h - v0.2.0 - public domain single-header audio library
 *
 *   Sound at a time on the ysp/rt.h clock. A buffer is played with
 *   yau_play_at(buf, t); the header plans its first sample on the device
 *   frame that t falls on, through a fit of the device clock against the
 *   ysp_rt clock, and reports where it landed: the stream frame, its time
 *   from that fit, the residual, and whether a device position report
 *   confirmed the frame played (a tier). The time is the fit's, never an
 *   observed time. A stream (a ring that another thread fills: a long WAV
 *   file, a movie's soundtrack, synthesis) plays the same way, with the same
 *   records, and its sample s plays on one fixed frame, origin + s. Also
 *   WAV files (RIFF, RF64, BW64) streamed or loaded, tones, noise and clicks
 *   at the project rate, a strict open that refuses any format or rate
 *   conversion, and the device and source interfaces of the rig's Audio
 *   device and Audio source extensions.
 *
 *   REQUIRES ysp/rt.h beside it (the clock, the event ring, the thread
 *   elevation, the instrumentation macros), and miniaudio 0.11.25 or a
 *   later 0.11 release (miniaudio.h, one public-domain file) on the include
 *   path for the device backends. YAU_NO_MINIAUDIO builds the core alone.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. C99 is
 *   the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC
 *   compiles by default.

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.2.0 - streams: yau_stream, a ring-fed voice played by yau_play()
 *          with .stream (or yau_play_stream), planned, recorded and
 *          confirmed as a buffer is; sample s on stream frame origin + s,
 *          late starts and ring underruns skip samples (GAPS); records
 *          YAU_EV_STREAM and YAU_EV_GAP, flag YAU_ONSET_GAP,
 *          yau_onset.sample and .gap_frames, yau_caps.gaps. WAV files:
 *          yau_wav (RIFF, RF64, BW64; 16-bit, 24-bit, 24 in 32, float)
 *          streamed from a path, memory or a byte-range reader, with
 *          yrt_pump hooks, and yau_wav_load into the arena. One gain,
 *          fade and routing kernel for buffers and streams (a buffer's
 *          output is byte for byte v0.1.0's). YAU_ERR_IO.
 *   v0.1.0 - first release: the scheduler and mixer, the device-clock fit,
 *          the onset confirmed by position reports past its frame, WASAPI
 *          shared and exclusive through miniaudio with IAudioClock
 *          positions, miniaudio's null device, the device and source
 *          interfaces, synthesis, the records, the parameter table.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.2.0. Streams, measured on the same laptop and device (AC,
 *   MSVC /O2, rows interleaved; docs/audio.md "Streams"): render cost
 *   per callback with 32 voices 10.35 us mean (v0.1.0 in the same session
 *   11.38), with 1 stream 10.48, with 4 streams 12.07 (p99 34.7); 0 gaps
 *   and 0 underruns in every row. A WAV stream on a yrt_pump under load
 *   (8 spinning threads, a 60 Hz frame loop) had 0 gaps for 3 minutes with
 *   rings of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 s; the default stays 1 s for the margin it
 *   leaves a producer that stalls (480 ms). 0 heap calls while 4 streams
 *   play. A WAV feed of 4096 frames costs the producer 5 to 24 us mean.
 *   Placement through a stream was checked on the scripted device only
 *   (every sample on frame origin + s, 2880 ring wraps, gaps, late starts,
 *   drift +-100 ppm); no loopback run with a stream yet (--line --stream
 *   is built). The buffer path is byte for byte v0.1.0's. The rest of
 *   this block is v0.1.0's, unchanged. Software timestamps only, on one Windows 11 25H2 laptop
 *   (i7-1360P), "Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio)" in WASAPI shared mode at 48000
 *   Hz, float, 2 channels, through miniaudio 0.11.25. No loopback cable was
 *   available: the delay to sound is UNMEASURED, desc.onset_offset_ns stays
 *   0 until tests/loopback/audio_loopback.c --line runs, and the OS's
 *   claim (0 ms on WASAPI) is not checked. docs/audio.md has the tables.
 *   Shared mode ran a 10 ms period whatever was asked; 10 minutes idle and
 *   3 minutes under load (8 spinning threads and a 60 Hz frame loop) gave 0
 *   underruns, callback interval p99 10.29 to 10.35 ms. The device ran +3.9
 *   ppm against QPC. Placement, through WASAPI's own loopback capture of the
 *   same endpoint (after the endpoint volume and an effect, so not bit-exact
 *   there): every burst at its planned frame distance from the one before in
 *   runs whose capture had no gap (700 of 700 idle, 500 of 500 under load).
 *   Time, capture against the onset record: deviation from the median 21.8
 *   us p50 and 67.3 us p99 idle (bar: 20.8 us, one frame; missed), 6.2 and
 *   19.8 us under load; the median, 33 ms, is the tap's offset, not a
 *   latency. The shortest lead with no LATE record was 43.5 to 54.5 ms.
 *   A WASAPI position is the engine's last pass stamped at the call (a
 *   report can be hundreds of us late); the reports are fitted by least
 *   squares on the least late report of each 200 ms, which predicted the
 *   next second within 110 us p99 over 10 minutes against 357 us for the
 *   lower envelope; callback times by the envelope (207 against 359 us). In
 *   a 60 ms stall the position halted at the frames written and later
 *   frames played 40 ms later; the fit restarts. Under load the position
 *   once jumped up to 45 ms ahead for tens of seconds; such reports are now
 *   kept out of the fit and flag the sounds in flight. Tiers: an onset's
 *   time is always the fit's, never observed, so no path is tier 1; WASAPI
 *   shared onsets confirmed by position reports are tier 2 on the
 *   conditions above (67 us p99 from the median idle, 20 us under load in
 *   one run, against a one-frame bar of 20.8 us). Exclusive mode (3
 *   runs of 30 s) delivered callbacks in bursts with 2 underruns a run: not
 *   usable on this machine. Cost per callback with 32 voices: 18.7 us mean,
 *   56.7 us p99; GetPosition() 2 to 4 us p50; one refit 5.5 us p50; the
 *   frame thread 1.5 us mean, 2.6 us p99 per play. No heap call from the
 *   header after open, none in open with a caller's arena (MSVC debug, the
 *   C runtime's hook; miniaudio's 10 at open are its own). A core test with
 *   a scripted device on a virtual clock (no miniaudio, no sound hardware)
 *   on MSVC, MinGW gcc 16.1, gcc 11.4 (C99 -O3, ASan and UBSan,
 *   ThreadSanitizer) and emcc (node); fourteen mutations of the header each
 *   make it fail. Compiled, never run: CoreAudio (with its latency claims),
 *   ALSA, PulseAudio, Web Audio (emcc as gnu11).
 *   Outside this STATUS block and docs/audio.md, a number in this header
 *   is a measurement only where the text says "measured".
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header to create the
 *   implementation. Every other file just includes the header normally.
 *   ysp/rt.h's implementation comes with it, once, as with the other ysp
 *   headers, and so does miniaudio's (see BUILDING).
 *
 *   Play a tone at a time t on the ysp_rt clock:
 *
 *       #define YSP_AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       #include "ysp/audio.h"
 *
 *       static yau_audio au;                          // zeroed
 *       if (!yau_open(&au, &(yau_desc){0}))         // 48 kHz, 2 channels
 *           die(yau_error(&au));
 *       yau_buf beep = yau_tone(&au, &(yau_tone_desc){
 *           .hz = 1000, .dur = YAU_MS(100), .peak = 0.03f, .ramp = YAU_MS(5) });
 *       yau_id id = yau_play_at(&au, beep, t);
 *       ...
 *       yau_onset r;
 *       if (yau_result(&au, id, &r) == YAU_OK)      // or yau_wait()
 *           printf("%lld ns late, tier %d\n", (long long)r.residual, r.tier);
 *
 *   Psychtoolbox and PsychoPy, for comparison:
 *
 *       pa = PsychPortAudio('Open', [], 1, 1, 48000, 2);          % PTB
 *       PsychPortAudio('FillBuffer', pa, repmat(MakeBeep(1000, 0.1, 48000) * 0.03, 2, 1));
 *       onset = PsychPortAudio('Start', pa, 1, t, 1);
 *
 *       beep = sound.Sound(1000, secs=0.1, volume=0.03)           # PsychoPy
 *       beep.play(when=t)
 *
 *   yau_play_at() does not block. Its record arrives later, in the handle
 *   (yau_result) and in the event ring. yau_wait() blocks for it, as
 *   PsychPortAudio's waitForStart does. In C++17, zero a desc and set its
 *   fields one by one.
 *
 *   A long WAV file, streamed, at t, with a fade 30 s later:
 *
 *       static yau_wav story;                         // zeroed; owns its ring
 *       if (yau_wav_open(&au, &story, &(yau_wav_desc){ .path = "story.wav" }) < 0)
 *           die(yau_wav_error(&story));
 *       yau_wav_feed(&story, 0);                      // fill the ring (1 s)
 *       yau_id id = yau_play_stream(&au, &story.stream, t);
 *       yau_stop_at(&au, id, t + YAU_S(30), YAU_MS(50));
 *       ...                                             // each frame: feed it,
 *       yau_wav_feed(&story, 0);                      // or let a pump do it (WAV FILES)
 *
 *   From ysp/timeline.h: an event on a channel that the program maps to a
 *   sound goes to yau_play_at() at the event's own RT time, before that
 *   time. yau_lead_ns() says how far before (MODEL, LEAD).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TIME
 *     Every time is an int64_t count of nanoseconds on the ysp/rt.h clock,
 *     the unit ysp/timeline.h and ysp/screen.h take. A device that reports
 *     on another clock converts at the boundary: WASAPI's position stamp is
 *     QueryPerformanceCounter time in 100 ns units, the counter
 *     yrt_now_ns() reads.
 *
 *   THE STREAM
 *     The stream frame W counts the frames the header has handed to the
 *     device since open. Every plan and every record is in stream frames.
 *     A device position report (P, t) says that stream frame P was at the
 *     device's output at ysp_rt time t. On WASAPI it is
 *     IAudioClock::GetPosition(), read at every callback.
 *
 *   THE FIT
 *     The header fits t = t0 + (W - W0) * k to the reports (or, with no
 *     reports, to the callback entry times) over a sliding window, and
 *     refits once a second. k is the device's real frame period on the
 *     ysp_rt clock. Two clocks with their own crystals drift apart by
 *     tens of ppm; at 50 ppm a fixed rate would be one frame (20.8 us at
 *     48 kHz) wrong after 0.42 s, and 180 ms wrong after an hour. The fit
 *     follows the drift, so a plan stays on its frame. Reports pair a
 *     position with its own stamp, and are fitted by least squares.
 *     Callback entry times are late and never early, so they are fitted by
 *     their lower envelope (the line under every point with the smallest
 *     summed gap; Moon, Skelly and Towsley, INFOCOM 1999), which least
 *     squares would bias by the mean lateness. Each refit is a
 *     YAU_EV_FIT record. open() runs the stream silent until the fit
 *     spans 0.5 s.
 *
 *   PLAN
 *     The callback, not yau_play_at(), turns t into a frame, from the
 *     newest fit, and again in every callback until the sound starts, so a
 *     newer fit corrects it. The frame is the first one at or after the
 *     fractional frame of t minus a half: the nearest frame, a tie to the
 *     earlier one, which is ysp/timeline.h's rule at frame scale. So the
 *     residual includes up to half a frame of rounding (10.4 us at 48
 *     kHz). There is no sub-frame placement: it would need a filter on the
 *     stimulus. A target whose frame has already gone to the device starts
 *     on the first frame that has not, flagged LATE.
 *
 *   CONFIRMATION
 *     An onset's TIME is always the fit's time for its frame, a model
 *     value: no API reports when a given frame reached the output. What a
 *     position report adds is confirmation, in order: the device has
 *     played past the frame, with no underrun since the frame was
 *     rendered, so the frame is where the plan put it and the fit, made of
 *     the OS's own position reports, held while it played. The record
 *     completes then, about a buffer after the callback rendered the
 *     frame. An onset with no such report (no reports on this backend, an
 *     underrun, the stream closed first) completes with the same kind of
 *     time and YAU_ONSET_UNCONFIRMED. A time between two reports around
 *     the frame was the first design; measured on the test laptop, a
 *     WASAPI position is the audio engine's last pass, stamped when the
 *     call is made, so a single report can be hundreds of microseconds
 *     late, and the fit over many reports is the better time.
 *
 *   NO RESAMPLING, NO INSERTED FRAMES
 *     The header never resamples a buffer or the stream and never adds or
 *     drops a frame to follow the ysp_rt clock. Drift is absorbed by
 *     planning each onset in device frames. A long buffer therefore plays
 *     at the device's rate, and its end is off from start + n / rate by n
 *     times the drift; the END record gives where it really ended. Locking
 *     a movie's soundtrack to its video is ysp/video.h's job: the
 *     soundtrack is a stream, its sample s plays on frame origin + s, and
 *     the movie clock follows yau_stream_sample_at() (STREAMS).
 *
 *   LEAD
 *     A sound must reach the callback before the callback renders the
 *     frame it starts on. yau_lead_ns() is the shortest lead that can
 *     still be met now: the time of the first frame the next callback will
 *     render, plus one period, minus now. Hand sounds over at least that
 *     far ahead; ysp/timeline.h's look-ahead for audio is this number.
 *
 *   UNDERRUNS
 *     A callback that comes too late leaves the device without data. The
 *     header sees it from the reports (the device has played everything it
 *     was given) or, without reports, from a gap between callbacks longer
 *     than the buffer. Each one is a YAU_EV_XRUN record; every sound
 *     playing or waiting for its report then is flagged XRUN, and an
 *     onset not yet confirmed stays unconfirmed (tier 3). Measured on WASAPI, the position
 *     halts at the frames written while the device has no data, so every
 *     later frame plays later by the time it stood: the fit starts over
 *     from the next reports. A device whose position counts the silence it
 *     played instead shows it as the position past the frames written; the
 *     header then shifts its map by that many frames and keeps the fit.
 *
 *   THE RECORD (yau_onset)
 *     id, target (t as given), onset (+ desc.onset_offset_ns), residual
 *     (onset - target), start_frame and end_frame (stream frames),
 *     device_pos (the report that confirmed it, or -1), rendered_at
 *     (when the callback rendered start_frame: onset - rendered_at is the
 *     lead the path used), buffer_id, tier and flags: PENDING, LATE,
 *     CANCELED (never started), STOPPED (ended early by a call), XRUN,
 *     CLIPPED (the mix went past full scale while it played), UNCONFIRMED
 *     (no position report confirmed the frame played), BELOW_TIER, LOST
 *     (the device went away), GAP (a stream played silence for missing
 *     samples). onset is the fit's time in every record. sample is the
 *     source's sample on start_frame (a buffer's offset; a stream's index,
 *     -1 if it never started); gap_frames the silent frames of a stream,
 *     final once end_frame is set.
 *
 *   TIERS (yau_tier, record.tier, caps.worst_tier, desc.min_tier)
 *     1  the onset is the OS's observation of that frame at the output,
 *        on a path a loopback test verified. No v0.1 path: every onset is
 *        a fit's time (CONFIRMATION).
 *     2  good under stated conditions: the time from the device-clock fit
 *        of OS position reports, the frame confirmed played with no
 *        underrun, on a path whose placement and time a loopback test
 *        checked on this machine. WASAPI shared on the test laptop: every
 *        burst at its planned frame in WASAPI's own loopback capture, and
 *        the capture against the record 67 us p99 from its median idle and
 *        20 us under load in one run (STATUS)
 *     3  unconfirmed (no report past the frame), or a path no loopback
 *        checked (WASAPI exclusive, which did not run usably here), or
 *        callback times only (CoreAudio, ALSA, PulseAudio, Web Audio in
 *        v0.1)
 *     YAU_TIER_SIM  the null device, or a device that says so
 *     desc.min_tier (1 to 3) flags BELOW_TIER on each onset worse than it;
 *     the run goes on.
 *
 *   THE RING
 *     With desc.ring set, the callback pushes, source YRT_SRC_AUDIO:

 *     and once a second a raw position report, YRT_SRC_RT /
 *     YRT_KIND_CLOCK: u.u64[0] the position in stream frames, u.u64[1] 0
 *     (the stamp is the device's), aux 0x41550000 + device_index, so the
 *     analysis can fit again offline. Every record is pushed with t_ns and
 *     tid set, so a push makes no system call.
 *
 *   OS LATENCY CLAIMS (caps.os_latency_ns, os_stream_latency_ns, _src)
 *     What the OS says about the delay to the output, as a claim, never as
 *     part of an onset. An onset is the time at the position point plus
 *     desc.onset_offset_ns, which only a line-in loopback test measures.
 *     os_latency_ns is the OS's claim from the position point to the
 *     output; os_stream_latency_ns is the API's own latency figure for the
 *     stream; -1 means no claim. Both go in the describe line and in a
 *     YAU_EV_CLAIM record at open (i64[0], i64[1], the API's name in
 *     bytes 16..39). On WASAPI the position is, in Microsoft's words, "the
 *     stream position of the sample that is currently playing through the
 *     speakers", so the claim is 0; the stream figure is
 *     IAudioClient::GetStreamLatency, "the maximum latency for the current
 *     stream". On CoreAudio (compiled, not run): kAudioDevicePropertyLatency
 *     plus kAudioDevicePropertySafetyOffset, and the buffer frame size on
 *     top for the stream figure. ALSA and PulseAudio: no claim in v0.1.
 *     PortAudio's equivalents are Pa_GetStreamInfo()->outputLatency and a
 *     callback's outputBufferDacTime; PsychPortAudio reports the same
 *     figures in GetStatus as PredictedLatency. The loopback test's --line
 *     mode prints the measured latency minus the claim.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PROJECT FORMAT AND STRICT OPEN
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   desc.format is the project's rate (default 48000 Hz), channel count
 *   (default 2), channel map and resolution (YAU_F32, YAU_S16,
 *   YAU_S24). In memory every buffer is float, interleaved, at the
 *   project rate: 16- and 24-bit values are exact in a float.
 *
 *   open() asks the device for nothing and reads what the OS gives: the
 *   miniaudio device gets no format, no rate and no channel count, so
 *   neither Windows nor miniaudio converts anything. It then refuses, with
 *   a message that names what the device gave, unless the device rate is
 *   the project rate, the channel count is the project's, the channel map
 *   is desc.format.map (when given), and the device resolution is at
 *   least the project's (float counts as 24 bits). There is no fallback.
 *
 *   On Windows the device rate is the endpoint's Default Format in the
 *   Sound control panel, in shared AND in exclusive mode: miniaudio opens
 *   exclusive mode at that format too. Change it there (Sound > the device
 *   > Properties > Advanced), or change the project rate. Another rate in
 *   exclusive mode needs an Audio device extension that owns WASAPI.
 *
 *   The mixer writes the device's own sample format (float in shared mode;
 *   for example 32-bit integers with 24 valid bits in exclusive mode),
 *   rounding to nearest, with no dither, clipping at full scale and
 *   flagging every sound that played while it clipped. One sound at unity
 *   gain reproduces a 16- or 24-bit buffer bit for bit.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PLAYING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yau_play_at(au, buf, t) and yau_play(au, &desc) queue a sound and
 *   return its id, a positive number (with desc.stream, a stream: STREAMS). A negative return is an error code:
 *   a bad argument, a full queue, every voice in use, a closed or lost
 *   device, a buffer whose channel count is neither 1 nor the project's.
 *   A target already too late is not an error; the record says LATE.
 *   desc.at 0 means the first frame the stream can still reach. desc.db is
 *   the gain (0 = unity), desc.channels a mask of output channels (0 =
 *   all): a mono buffer is copied to every channel in the mask, a buffer
 *   with the project's channel count plays only the channels in it.
 *   desc.offset and desc.frames choose a part of the buffer, desc.loops
 *   repeats it (YAU_FOREVER until stopped).
 *
 *   yau_cancel(id): a sound that has not started never plays (CANCELED);
 *   one that has stops at the next callback, with no ramp, so it can click.
 *   yau_stop_at(id, t, ramp): a raised-cosine fade of ramp ns that ends
 *   at t, on its frames (id 0: every sound). yau_gain_at(id, t, db,
 *   ramp): a linear change of gain that starts at t. There is no master
 *   gain; the OS volume is the user's.
 *
 *   yau_update() moves completed records from the callback into the
 *   handle; yau_result(), yau_wait() and yau_play() call it.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   STREAMS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A stream is a voice whose samples come from a ring that a producer
 *   thread fills while it plays: a file too long for memory, a movie's
 *   soundtrack, synthesis. It is played, planned, stopped, faded, routed,
 *   recorded and confirmed as a buffer is, by the same code; only where the
 *   samples come from differs.
 *
 *       static yau_stream st;                         // yours; 256 bytes
 *       yau_stream_init(&au, &st, &(yau_stream_desc){ .channels = 1 });
 *       ...                                             // the producer thread:
 *       int64_t n;
 *       float* p;
 *       while ((p = yau_stream_acquire(&st, &n)) != NULL) {  // up to the wrap
 *           synth(p, n);
 *           yau_stream_commit(&st, n);
 *       }
 *       ...                                             // the frame thread:
 *       yau_id id = yau_play_stream(&au, &st, t);   // or yau_play(.stream)
 *
 *   THE RING holds project-rate float samples, interleaved, 1 or the
 *   project's channels (desc.frames, default 1 s), in desc.memory or the
 *   handle's arena. The producer widens integer samples to float itself:
 *   that is exact for 16 and 24 bits and is not a conversion of the sound.
 *   One producer thread at a time (which may be the frame thread), one
 *   reader (the device thread), 64-bit sample counts, acquire and release
 *   only: no lock, no allocation, no I/O on the device thread. A mono ring
 *   goes to every channel in the play's mask, as a mono buffer does.
 *   yau_stream_end() says no sample follows the last one committed; the
 *   play then ends there (END, not STOPPED). Without it the stream plays,
 *   or plays silence, until it is stopped.
 *
 *   THE LOCK RULE. In the block that renders its first frame, the callback
 *   fixes origin, the stream frame of sample 0: sample s plays on stream
 *   frame origin + s for the whole play. yau_stream_get_info() gives
 *   origin to any thread once .started is set; yau_stream_sample_at()
 *   and yau_stream_time_of() turn samples into ysp_rt times and back
 *   through the fit (frame thread). A movie clock that follows
 *   sample_at(t) follows the sound frame for frame. Nothing moves origin:
 *     A GAP. When the ring has no sample for a frame, the frame stays
 *     silent and the stream's position moves on by exactly that frame; the
 *     samples that arrive after their frame are discarded, never played
 *     late. Each run of silent frames is one YAU_EV_GAP record, the play
 *     is flagged GAP, and the counters in get_info (gaps, gap_frames,
 *     discarded), yau_onset.gap_frames and yau_caps.gaps count every
 *     one, also with no event ring. The edges of a gap are not ramped: a
 *     gap is a failure, and a ramp would change samples that did arrive.
 *     A LATE START. A target whose frame has gone to the device starts on
 *     the first frame that has not, LATE, with origin from the target, so
 *     the samples it missed are skipped (STREAM record i64[3]). A buffer
 *     instead starts late from its first sample.
 *
 *   SCHEDULING. At t > 0, as a buffer: the first sample is planned on the
 *   frame nearest t, in every block until it starts. Nothing about the
 *   ring is checked at the call, because the producer may catch up before
 *   a start seconds away; a start with an empty ring is a gap and the
 *   ONSET is still on the planned frame, flagged GAP. get_info's ready
 *   (the ring holds .preroll frames) and frames_to_start (the planned
 *   start frame minus the frame of the device's next block) tell the
 *   caller beforehand. At 0 a stream, unlike a buffer, waits until the
 *   ring holds desc.preroll frames (default a quarter of the ring;
 *   YAU_PREROLL_NONE: no wait) or every sample up to its end, and starts
 *   on the next block; the ONSET record shows when that was.
 *
 *   CONFIRMATION. The ONSET of a stream is confirmed exactly as a
 *   buffer's: tier 2 on WASAPI shared under the STATUS conditions,
 *   UNCONFIRMED and tier 3 otherwise. GAP records are not confirmed: a
 *   gap's frames are exact by construction (the mixer wrote the silence on
 *   them) and its time is the fit's, as an END record's is; whether the
 *   device timing held around it, the XRUN records say for the whole
 *   stream, in stream frames.
 *
 *   STATES (get_info .state). IDLE: fill it, play it. yau_play() takes
 *   it (QUEUED), the callback holds it (WAITING, then PLAYING), the play
 *   ends (ENDED). yau_stream_reset(st, first) empties the ring and
 *   numbers the next sample `first`; it is the producer's call and is
 *   YAU_ERR_BUSY unless the stream is IDLE or ENDED, so a stream plays
 *   once per reset and a reset can never race a play: a play takes the
 *   stream by compare-and-swap, and so does a reset. To seek: stop the
 *   play, reset at the new sample when it has ended, fill, play.
 *
 *   LOOPS are the producer's: write sample s from source position s mod A.
 *   The ring is read once, a loop held in memory is a buffer (which loops),
 *   and the sample count must go on across cycles for the lock rule.
 *   yau_wav does it (.loops). .loops, .offset, .frames and .buf with
 *   .stream are YAU_ERR_ARG.
 *
 *   yau_stream_release() ends an arena stream's hold on
 *   yau_arena_reset(), which is YAU_ERR_BUSY while one exists.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   WAV FILES
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yau_wav reads a WAV file from a path, from memory or through a
 *   yau_reader (bytes by range, a pack entry; the same layout as
 *   ysp/video.h's yvid_reader) and streams it through its own stream,
 *   .stream. yau_wav_load() reads a whole file into the arena as a
 *   buffer instead. Accepted: RIFF, RF64 and BW64 (sizes from ds64),
 *   16-bit and 24-bit PCM, 24 valid bits in 32 (WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE; the
 *   low byte is padding), 32-bit float, plain or EXTENSIBLE. Refused, with
 *   a message that names what the file has: any other format (8-bit, 32-bit
 *   integers and 64-bit floats are not exact in float), a rate that is not
 *   the device's (ysp_audio never resamples), a channel count that is
 *   neither 1 nor the project's, an EXTENSIBLE speaker mask that differs
 *   from desc.format.map, a damaged file. A float sample that is not a
 *   number ends the stream before it, with the sample in the error.
 *
 *   Feeding is the producer's: yau_wav_feed(w, 0) fills the ring.
 *   yau_wav_step is a yrt_idle_fn (one block of up to 4096 frames;
 *   true while there is room) and yau_wav_on_msg a yrt_msg_fn (a
 *   yau_wav_msg: a seek, or -1 to wake), so a pump does the reading:
 *
 *       yrt_pump_start(&pump, &(yrt_pump_desc){
 *           .msg_size = sizeof(yau_wav_msg), .capacity = 4,
 *           .on_msg = yau_wav_on_msg, .on_idle = yau_wav_step, .ctx = &story });
 *       ...                                                  // each frame
 *       if (yau_wav_wants(&story))                         // ring under half
 *           yrt_pump_submit(&pump, &(yau_wav_msg){ .seek = -1 });
 *
 *   A seek waits for the play to end (yau_wav_seek is YAU_ERR_BUSY
 *   until then; a seek message is kept and applied by the next step).
 *   .loops repeats the file (YAU_FOREVER), counting samples on. A path
 *   is opened with stdio and no stdio buffer (setvbuf _IONBF), so the C
 *   runtime allocates nothing on the producer thread; reads go to the OS
 *   (ReadFile, read()) 16 KB at a time and the OS file cache still applies.
 *   It is not FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING or O_DIRECT, which need sector-aligned
 *   offsets and buffers. Only open, close and load (frame thread) and the
 *   producer calls touch the file.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SYNTHESIS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yau_tone(), yau_noise() and yau_click() fill a buffer in the
 *   handle's arena at the project rate and return it; yau_alloc() returns
 *   a zeroed one to fill yourself. yau_fill_tone() and yau_fill_noise()
 *   do the same into your memory, with no handle. Levels are linear and
 *   required, because a zero default must not mean full scale: .peak for a
 *   tone or a click, .rms for noise; yau_db(-30) is 0.0316. .ramp is a
 *   raised-cosine onset and offset, each that long. The sine is computed
 *   from the frame index, so a long tone does not drift in phase. A
 *   synthesized buffer is mono unless .channels says otherwise, and play
 *   routes it.
 *
 *   Noise is white, Gaussian (default) or uniform, from the 64-bit .seed:
 *   splitmix64 seeds xoshiro256+, Box-Muller makes the Gaussian values, so
 *   one seed gives the same samples on every platform. ysp/trials.h's draw
 *   is the place to get a seed. NOISE THAT WOULD CLIP IS REFUSED: a
 *   Gaussian draw has no bound, so at rms 0.3 a one-second buffer almost
 *   surely holds a sample past 1.0 (3.3 standard deviations). The error
 *   message gives the buffer's peak and the largest rms that would have
 *   fit for that seed; pick a lower rms or the uniform distribution, whose
 *   peak is rms x 1.73.
 *
 *   yau_arena_reset() frees the whole arena; it refuses (YAU_ERR_BUSY)
 *   while a sound from the arena is playing or waiting.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BACKENDS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   YAU_BACKEND_WASAPI (Windows; AUTO there)
 *     Shared mode by default; desc.exclusive takes the device for this
 *     program alone, and every other program goes silent. Through
 *     miniaudio with low-latency shared mode (IAudioClient3) when the
 *     driver has it, no automatic conversion, no hardware offload and no
 *     automatic rerouting: a default-device change makes the device LOST.
 *     Positions: IAudioClock, called in each callback.
 *   YAU_BACKEND_COREAUDIO, _ALSA, _PULSE, _WEB
 *     Compiled through miniaudio. v0.1 reads no position on them, so every
 *     onset is unconfirmed (tier 3) and the fit uses callback times. They have
 *     not run here (STATUS).
 *   YAU_BACKEND_NULL
 *     miniaudio's null device: a timer, no hardware. Tier SIM.
 *   YAU_BACKEND_CUSTOM
 *     desc.dev and desc.dev_ctx: your device (DEVICE).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   DEVICE (the Audio device extension)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A yau_device is a table of functions: open (fill yau_device_caps
 *   with what the hardware really runs at), start (begin calling the
 *   render function from the device's real-time thread), stop, close and
 *   describe. The device calls render(host, out, frames, &tick) once per
 *   block from one thread, with tick.t_entry (yrt_now_ns() at callback
 *   entry), tick.pos and tick.pos_t (a position report in stream frames
 *   and ysp_rt time, or pos -1) and tick.flags (YAU_TICK_XRUN when the
 *   API reported a gap). out is in the device's format (caps.out). The
 *   device owns its OS objects and converts its times to the ysp_rt clock;
 *   the core owns the plan, the fit, the mix and the records. The thread
 *   that will call render calls yau_rt_thread_init(host) once, before
 *   start. The header's timing statements end at this boundary for a
 *   device that is not its own. tests/adapt/audio_test.c has one.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SOURCE (the Audio source extension)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   desc.source: a function that adds frames into the float block the
 *   mixer is building, after the voices, with the frame's stream index and
 *   time (yau_clock). It runs on the device thread: it must not
 *   allocate, lock, do I/O or take unbounded time. One source per handle.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A stream is 256 bytes in your memory, one cache line per writer (the
 *   producer's, the device thread's, the setup, the device thread's own),
 *   plus its ring; a yau_wav is about 17 KB (its stream and a 16 KB read
 *   buffer), so nothing allocates while it plays. A stream voice keeps its
 *   stream pointer in the buffer pointer's place, so the voice array, the
 *   hot data of every block, does not grow (200 bytes a voice).
 *   The handle, about 142 KB, holds the voices, the command and
 *   completion queues, the results of the last 256 sounds, the fit window
 *   and the miniaudio context and device: make it static or allocate it,
 *   not a local. The ONLY allocation the header makes is the
 *   synthesis arena: when desc.arena is NULL, open() takes desc.arena_bytes
 *   (default 8 MB) with malloc, and close() frees it. With your own arena
 *   the header's code allocates nothing. miniaudio allocates its own
 *   objects inside open(), none afterwards. The callback, yau_play(),
 *   yau_update() and yau_result() allocate nothing and take no lock;
 *   the two queues are single-producer single-consumer rings.
 *   One thread calls the API for a handle (the frame thread). A stream's
 *   producer calls (acquire, commit, write, end, reset, and yau_wav_feed,
 *   seek, step, on_msg) come from one other thread at a time, or the frame
 *   thread; yau_stream_get_info and yau_wav_wants from any. The device
 *   thread is miniaudio's; on WASAPI it joins MMCSS's "Pro Audio" task.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Put miniaudio.h (0.11.25 or a later 0.11) on the include path, or name
 *   it in YAU_MINIAUDIO_HEADER. The implementation block defines
 *   MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION, with miniaudio's decoding, encoding, engine,
 *   resource manager, node graph and generation parts left out, unless the
 *   translation unit already included miniaudio's implementation or
 *   defines YAU_MINIAUDIO_EXTERNAL (miniaudio compiled elsewhere). Link
 *   -ldl -lpthread -lm on Linux. Windows links nothing: miniaudio loads its
 *   DLLs at run time. Define YAU_NO_MINIAUDIO to build the core with
 *   YAU_BACKEND_CUSTOM only. Include ysp/audio.h (or ysp/rt.h) before
 *   any system header in the implementation file. Define YAU_API to
 *   change the linkage of every function.
 *   Hot paths carry ysp/rt.h's instrumentation macros: zones yau.render,
 *   yau.mix, yau.fit; a plot of the queue depth in frames.
 *
