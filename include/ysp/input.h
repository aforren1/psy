/* ysp/input.h - v0.3.0 - public domain single-header input event
 *
 *   One timestamped input event for every device a rig reads: keyboards,
 *   mice, touch, pens, gamepads, response and button boxes, eye trackers.
 *   Producers (ysp/screen.h's SDL events and raw mice, a serial box reader,
 *   an eye tracker) make these events; consumers (ysp/response.h's
 *   collector, a data log, the player's input.key) read them, and neither
 *   side needs the other's header. Also: the timing quality of a source
 *   (the tier scale of ysp/screen.h and ysp/audio.h), and adapters from
 *   SDL3 events and ysp/screen.h's raw mouse reports.
 *
 *   Types and inline functions only: nothing to implement, nothing to
 *   link, no heap, no OS calls. C99 is the floor: it builds as C99, C11
 *   and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default. The SDL3
 *   adapter appears when SDL3's SDL_events.h was included first (or when
 *   this header is included again after it).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.3.0 - For specialized devices (docs/devices_spec.md): YIN_KIND_SYNC
 *          (7) for timing events that are not a participant's response
 *          (scanner pulses, TTL inputs, photodiode and sound-key edges);
 *          unc_us, the event's own uncertainty, in the 2 bytes that were
 *          reserved_ (offset 26); ticks, the device clock's raw count, in
 *          the 4 bytes of tail padding (offset 44), valid with the new flag
 *          YIN_DEVTICKS; the eye controls YIN_EYE_* and eye codes. The
 *          size (48) and every existing offset and value are unchanged.
 *   v0.2.0 - The raw mouse report (yin_mouse_report, YIN_MOUSE_*) moved
 *          here from ysp/screen.h, so yin_from_mouse() needs no other
 *          header; ysp/screen.h's yscr_mouse_event and YSCR_MOUSE_*
 *          are its aliases. The SDL3 adapter is defined when this header
 *          is included again after SDL3, so ysp/screen.h's implementation
 *          uses it for yscr_event_input().
 *   v0.1.0 - split out of ysp/response.h v0.1.2: the event, its kinds,
 *          types, flags, controls and axes, the source entry and tiers,
 *          the SDL3 adapter and the raw mouse adapter, renamed from
 *          yrsp_ to yin_ (ysp/response.h keeps its names as aliases).
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.3.0, 2026-10-08 (v0.2.0's checks, and the new fields' offsets
 *   and constants). Built with MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 as C11, C99
 *   and C++17 under -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Werror and with
 *   MSVC 19.44 under /W4 /WX as C11 and C++17. tests/adapt/input_test.c
 *   checks the layout (48 bytes, the field offsets producers write), the
 *   constants' values (they are in data files), and both adapters on
 *   events filled by hand; ysp/response.h's test runs every adapter case
 *   again through its aliases.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Include it; there is no implementation to define. A producer:
 *
 *       yin_event e = { .t = yrt_now_ns(), .kind = YIN_KIND_BOX,
 *                         .device = port, .control = button,
 *                         .type = YIN_PRESS, .value = 1 };
 *
 *   From SDL3 (include SDL3 or ysp/screen.h first):
 *
 *       while (yscr_poll(&scr, &ev, &t))
 *           if (yin_from_sdl(&ev, t, NULL, &e)) yrsp_feed(&rsp, &e);
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   THE EVENT (yin_event)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   One 48-byte struct for every device:
 *     t        ysp_rt ns
 *     kind     YIN_KIND_KEYBOARD, _MOUSE, _TOUCH, _PEN, _GAMEPAD, _BOX
 *              (response box, button box, pedal, an Arduino-style device),
 *              _EYE, _SYNC (a timing event that is not a response: a
 *              scanner pulse, a TTL input, a photodiode or sound-key edge;
 *              control = the line or channel), _USER + 0..7
 *     device   the instance within the kind (SDL's `which`, a port index);
 *              0 = unknown
 *     type     PRESS, RELEASE, SAMPLE (a position or an axis value),
 *              PROXIMITY (value 1 in range, 0 out)
 *     control  keyboard: the SDL scancode (the USB HID usage: the physical
 *              key); mouse, pen, gamepad, box: the button; touch: the
 *              contact (finger) id, low 32 bits; a SAMPLE: an axis
 *              (YIN_AXIS_POSITION, YIN_AXIS_PEN + SDL_PenAxis,
 *              YIN_AXIS_GAMEPAD + SDL_GamepadAxis), except touch, whose
 *              SAMPLE control is the contact
 *     code     keyboard: the SDL keycode (the layout's key); else yours
 *     mods     keyboard: SDL_Keymod
 *     flags    YIN_REPEAT (the OS's auto-repeat of a held key),
 *              YIN_SYNTHETIC (made by the OS or SDL from another
 *              device), YIN_ERASER (the pen's eraser end),
 *              YIN_UNLISTED (a raw mouse SDL does not list),
 *              YIN_DEVTICKS (ticks is set)
 *     stamp    the stamp's tier (SOURCES); 0 = the source table's
 *     unc_us   this event's own uncertainty in us: a device clock fit's
 *              spread at this time, a bracket's width, a stamp's known
 *              quantizer; 0 = the source entry's bounds; 65535 = 65.5 ms
 *              or more
 *     x, y     position: window coordinates for mouse and pen, 0..1 for
 *              touch; pen tilt
 *     value    an axis value, pressure; 1 for a press, 0 for a release
 *     aux      yours
 *     ticks    with YIN_DEVTICKS: the low 32 bits of the device's own
 *              clock for this event, in the source's unit, so the analysis
 *              can map the event again with an offline fit of the clock
 *              pairs in the log (ysp/rt.h DEVICE CLOCK FIT). 32 bits are
 *              enough: the pairs carry the whole count
 *   Eye trackers (kind EYE): control YIN_EYE_GAZE with type SAMPLE (x, y
 *   window pixels, value the pupil); YIN_EYE_FIXATION, _SACCADE and
 *   _BLINK with PRESS at the start and RELEASE at the end; PROXIMITY with
 *   value 0 when the tracker loses the eye and 1 when it finds it again;
 *   code the eye (YIN_EYE_LEFT, _RIGHT, _BOTH).
 *   Consumers take them in arrival order. Their times need not rise:
 *   sources stamp differently (a response box's device clock, SDL's raw
 *   and message paths), so a consumer reads t, not the order
 *   (ysp/response.h does).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SOURCES AND TIMING QUALITY (yin_source)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Each source states how its stamps relate to the physical event, on
 *   the tier scale of ysp/screen.h and ysp/audio.h, for the whole chain
 *   from the finger to the stamp:
 *     YIN_TIER_UNKNOWN (0) not measured end to end
 *     YIN_TIER_1  a device clock mapped to ysp_rt by a fit that a
 *                    loopback test checked
 *     YIN_TIER_2  good under stated conditions, measured
 *     YIN_TIER_3  development only: a tick-quantized OS time, a poll
 *     YIN_TIER_SIM synthetic input, exact by construction
 *   An entry also gives measured bounds (lo_us, hi_us: stamp minus event)
 *   and `partial` when they cover the host part only (the OS saw it ->
 *   the stamp), not the device's scan, debounce and USB poll. The entry of
 *   a kind with device 0 covers every device of that kind; an entry with
 *   the device's id wins. event.stamp, when set, overrides the tier.
 *   ysp/response.h's result copies the responding source's tier, bounds
 *   and partial flag next to the onset's tier; it computes no combined
 *   uncertainty, because the two rest on different evidence.
 *   Measured on the one Windows 11 machine of ysp/screen.h's STATUS
 *   (docs/response.md and docs/screen.md have the tables): SDL
 *   3.4's raw keyboard path stamped keys sent with SendInput 0.16 to 0.67
 *   ms after the call; the message path 6.2 ms before to 12.1 ms after. Mouse, touch and pen
 *   events are stamped with the message time (read in SDL 3.4's source),
 *   not measured. yin_sdl_source() returns these as entries.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SDL3 (yin_from_sdl, defined when SDL_events.h came first)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Converts keyboard, mouse button and motion, touch, pen and gamepad
 *   events. It reads fields only and calls no SDL function. It drops the
 *   mouse events SDL makes from pen and touch input (which =
 *   SDL_PEN_MOUSEID, SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID) and the touch events it makes from
 *   a pen (SDL_PEN_TOUCHID) and a mouse, unless ctx.keep_synthetic.
 *   Keys come on the message path, stamped later and coarser, while SDL
 *   text input is on for the window, which another library can start (Dear
 *   ImGui's SDL3 backend does): set ctx.raw_keyboard from ysp/screen.h's
 *   caps.raw_keyboard each frame, and those keys get tier 3. Mouse events
 *   with which 0 (SDL's absolute mode, message-timed) get tier 3
 *   (yin_sdl_mouse_stamp). Gamepad axes become -1..1 (triggers 0..1).
 *   Mouse and pen positions are SDL's window coordinates; touch positions
 *   are 0..1. ysp/screen.h starts SDL's video subsystem only: for gamepads
 *   set its desc.gamepads, or call SDL_InitSubSystem(SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD) and
 *   open each gamepad (SDL_OpenGamepad) yourself.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   RAW MICE (yin_mouse_report, yin_from_mouse)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ysp/screen.h's desc.raw_mice (Windows) reads each mouse's Raw Input on
 *   a thread into yin_mouse_reports. yin_from_mouse() turns one report
 *   into up to 12 events of YIN_KIND_MOUSE with the
 *   mouse's device id, in this order: presses, releases (buttons numbered
 *   as SDL's: 1 left, 2 middle, 3 right, 4 and 5 the side buttons), a
 *   YIN_AXIS_DELTA sample (x, y in counts, unaccelerated) or a
 *   YIN_AXIS_ABSOLUTE sample (a tablet, remote desktop: x, y 0..1), a
 *   YIN_AXIS_WHEEL sample (value in notches, x the horizontal wheel). A
 *   mouse SDL does not list has YIN_UNLISTED. yin_raw_mouse_source() is
 *   its source entry (stamped at read; host part measured with injected
 *   input only).
