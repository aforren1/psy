/* ysp/stair.h - v0.1.2 - public domain single-header adaptive staircase library
 *
 *   Nonparametric adaptive procedures for psychophysics: transformed and
 *   weighted up/down staircases (Wetherill & Levitt 1965; Levitt 1971;
 *   Kaernbach 1991) and accelerated stochastic approximation (Kesten 1958;
 *   Robbins & Monro 1951). One handle is one staircase; interleave several
 *   by owning several handles.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no OS calls, no threads, no heap. Needs nothing but libm.
 *   Not a transport header, so it does not include ysp/rt.h.
 *
 *   Targets every platform the compiler does. C99 is the floor: it builds as
 *   C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.1.2 - documentation only. STATUS records the replay against
 *          Palamedes' PAL_AMUD, now done. The rule's counter sentence said
 *          "the counters reset on every step and on every change of
 *          direction", which could be read two ways; it now says what the
 *          code does (the opposite counter resets on every response, both on
 *          every step) and where that differs from PAL_AMUD. No code changed.
 *   v0.1.1 - version macros (YST_VERSION_MAJOR / MINOR / PATCH / STRING)
 *          and yst_version(), so a program can log which header it was
 *          built from. No behavior changed.
 *   v0.1 - first implementation. Defining YSP_STAIR_IMPLEMENTATION now
 *          compiles the library instead of failing. The manual gained the
 *          detail a specification could leave open and an implementation
 *          cannot: which step size the reversal trial itself takes (the new
 *          one, as in PsychoPy), the sign convention of YST_RULE_ASA and
 *          what its m_k counts, which recorded level each estimator
 *          averages, the order the stop criteria are tested in, and the
 *          rest of the descs yst_open() rejects. YST_EVENT_STEP now
 *          means "the rule stepped", not "the value changed", so a step
 *          held by a limit still reports one.
 *   v0.0 - specification. Declarations and the manual, no implementation.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.1.2. Built and run on Linux (WSL2) with gcc 11.4 as C11, C99 and
 *   C++17 under -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Werror, and once under
 *   -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all with no
 *   diagnostic. Also built and run on Windows 11 with MSVC 14.51 under
 *   /W4 /WX, both in its default (pre-C11) C dialect and as /std:c++17;
 *   every number the test prints is identical on the two compilers.
 *   tests/adapt/stair_test.c, at YST_MAX_TRIALS 128 and
 *   YST_MAX_REVERSALS 32, checks hand-derived tracks for 1-up-1-down,
 *   1-up-2-down, 1-up-3-down and 2-up-1-down (proposals, reversal indices,
 *   reversal levels), the step schedule, the initial rule, LIN / LOG / DB steps, the
 *   limits and every stop reason, the weighted rule, ASA, all four
 *   estimators, YST_ERR_FULL at YST_MAX_TRIALS, and every desc
 *   yst_open() is documented to reject. A simulated Weibull observer over
 *   204000 pooled trials puts the empirical proportion correct within 0.007
 *   of yst_convergence_p for 1-up-2-down (0.7105 against 0.7071),
 *   1-up-3-down (0.7970 against 0.7937) and a weighted 1-up-1-down (0.7565
 *   against 0.7500), against a 0.01 tolerance. All three sit ABOVE the
 *   target, which is the finite-step bias of the rule and not noise; shrink
 *   the step to shrink it.
 *   Replayed against Palamedes' PAL_AMUD through the MEX binding in MATLAB
 *   R2023a (tests/compare/compare_stair_palamedes.m), on fixed 80-trial
 *   response sequences: 1-up-2-down, 1-up-3-down, 2-up-1-down, a reversal
 *   stop, a weighted 1-up-1-down, limits, log10 steps and a caller-driven
 *   step schedule are identical, level for level and reversal for reversal.
 *   PAL_AMUD always applies the initial rule, so those descs set
 *   initial_rule. Two differences are documented rather than papered over.
 *   PAL_AMUD keeps the opposite-direction counter when a response causes no
 *   step, where this header resets it on every response; the two agree
 *   whenever n_up or n_down is 1 (see RULES). And a caller who changes
 *   Palamedes' step after the reversing update gives the reversal trial the
 *   OLD step, where this header, like PsychoPy, gives it the new one.
 *   PsychoPy's StairHandler is replayed too, through the Python binding
 *   (tests/compare/compare_stair_psychopy.py): on seven configurations
 *   (1-up-2-down and 1-up-3-down and 2-up-1-down, step schedules, the
 *   initial rule on and off, limits, linear, dB and log steps) no proposal
 *   differs on any trial, the reversal indices and levels are the same, and
 *   the estimates agree, the log and dB cases to 1e-15 because PsychoPy
 *   multiplies where this header adds in log units.
 *   What is NOT done here: nothing here is a timing measurement. No
 *   estimator is a fit and none carries a confidence interval. A
 *   -DYST_API=static build needs a translation unit that calls every
 *   function, or -Wno-unused-function.

 *   Do this:
 *

 *   implementation. Every other file just includes the header normally.
 *

 *       yst_stair s;
 *       if (!yst_open(&s, &d)) { fputs(yst_error(&s), stderr); return 1; }
 *
 *       while (!yst_done(&s)) {
 *           double level = yst_next(&s);
 *           int correct  = run_trial(level);          // 1 = correct, 0 = not
 *           yst_update(&s, level, correct);
 *       }
 *       double thr = yst_estimate(&s, YST_EST_REVERSALS);
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A staircase is a rule that maps the trial history to the next level.
 *   The level is a double in the caller's units (contrast, dB, degrees,
 *   log10 of any of those). The header does not know what the units mean;
 *   it only knows that a CORRECT response (or a detection, a "yes") makes
 *   the task HARDER, which by default means a SMALLER level. Set
 *   desc.harder_is_up when a larger level is the harder one (a delay to
 *   detect, a noise amplitude, a masker contrast).
 *
 *   THE LOOP
 *     yst_next(s)              the level the rule proposes for this trial
 *     yst_update(s, x, r)      what was actually shown, and the outcome
 *     yst_done(s)              has a stop criterion been met
 *     yst_estimate(s, how)     the threshold from the history so far
 *
 *   next() and update() are separate on purpose. The level you can show is
 *   not always the level the rule asked for: a display quantizes contrast,
 *   a device clips, an interleaved design shows a different staircase's
 *   trial. Pass the level you SHOWED to update(); the rule steps from the
 *   level it PROPOSED, so the two need not agree, and the history records
 *   both. update() with a level the rule did not propose does not reset
 *   anything.
 *
 *   DIRECTION
 *     "Down" and "up" in this manual are directions of the LEVEL VALUE, not
 *     of difficulty: down is a smaller number. yst_trial.direction is the
 *     sign of the change the rule made to its own level after that trial
 *     (-1, +1, or 0 for no step). With the default harder_is_up = false a
 *     correct response steps down; with harder_is_up = true it steps up, and
 *     then desc.step_down_scale still scales the HARDER step, which is the
 *     one a correct response takes. Reversals do not care: they are a change
 *     of sign either way.
 *
 *   RULES (desc.rule)
 *     YST_RULE_UPDOWN  (default)
 *       Transformed up/down: after n_down consecutive correct responses the
 *       level steps down (harder); after n_up consecutive incorrect
 *       responses it steps up (easier). Every response resets the OTHER
 *       direction's counter, so the runs are of consecutive responses, and
 *       every step resets both. That is where this header and Palamedes'
 *       PAL_AMUD part: PAL_AMUD keeps the opposite counter across a
 *       response that causes no step, so on a 2-up-2-down track the sequence
 *       wrong, right, wrong steps up at its third response in PAL_AMUD, which
 *       has counted two wrongs, and here only at the next wrong, because the
 *       right reset the count. The two agree whenever n_up or n_down is 1,
 *       which is every 1-up-N-down and N-up-1-down rule; see STATUS.
 *       1-up-1-down converges on 50%,
 *       1-up-2-down on 70.7%, 1-up-3-down on 79.4%, 1-up-4-down on 84.1%
 *       (Levitt 1971, Table 1; the value is 0.5^(1/n_down) for n_up = 1).
 *       Weighted up/down (Kaernbach 1991): when step_down_scale != 1 the
 *       down step is step * step_down_scale. With n_up = n_down = 1 the
 *       procedure converges on p = 1 / (1 + step_down_scale), so a
 *       target p is reached with step_down_scale = (1 - p) / p;
 *       yst_weighted_scale(p) computes it. Unlike the transformed rule,
 *       the weighted rule converges on any p in (0, 1) with one response
 *       per step.
 *     YST_RULE_ASA
 *       Accelerated stochastic approximation (Kesten 1958). After each
 *       trial the level moves TOWARD THE HARDER END by c / m_k *
 *       (r - p_target), where r is the response (0 or 1) and c is
 *       desc.steps[0]. So with the default harder_is_up = false the level
 *       changes by -c / m_k * (r - p_target), and a correct response at a
 *       target below 1 lowers it. m_k is 1 for the first two trials and
 *       thereafter 1 + the number of reversals so far, COUNTING a reversal
 *       on this trial, so the step shrinks from the reversal on rather than
 *       from the trial after it. There is no schedule: n_steps must be 1
 *       and step_down_scale must be 0 or 1. Converges on desc.target_p,
 *       which is required for this rule and must be in (0, 1). Use
 *       YST_STEP_LIN or YST_STEP_LOG; a log step moves log10(level).
 *
 *   STEPS (desc.step_type, desc.steps[], desc.n_steps)
 *     YST_STEP_LIN   level += step, level -= step
 *     YST_STEP_LOG   log10(level) += step, i.e. level *= 10^step. The
 *                      level must stay positive; open() rejects a start,
 *                      min or max <= 0 under this type, and update()
 *                      returns YST_ERR_ARG for a shown level <= 0.
 *     YST_STEP_DB    20*log10(level) += step, i.e. level *= 10^(step/20).
 *                      Same positivity rule.
 *     steps[] is the step schedule: steps[0] until the first reversal,
 *     steps[1] until the second, and so on; after n_steps - 1 reversals the
 *     last entry stays in force. The trial that CAUSES a reversal already
 *     steps by the new size, which is PsychoPy's StairHandler order and
 *     what yst_trial.step_index records. This is PsychoPy's StairHandler
 *     semantic and Palamedes' PAL_AMUD stepSizeUp/Down with a schedule on
 *     top. One entry is a fixed step. The schedule counts reversals, not
 *     trials, so a run of correct responses at the start does not consume
 *     it. Every entry up to n_steps must be finite and > 0.
 *     YST_MAX_STEPS bounds n_steps (16).
 *
 *   INITIAL RULE (desc.initial_rule)
 *     Until the first reversal, step after every response as 1-up-1-down
 *     would, regardless of n_up and n_down. This gets a start far from
 *     threshold to threshold in fewer trials, at the cost of a first
 *     reversal that is not part of the equilibrium. PsychoPy's
 *     applyInitialRule (default true there); off by default here, because
 *     it changes which reversals count, and the estimate section says how.
 *
 *   LIMITS (desc.min, desc.max)
 *     A proposed level is clamped to [min, max] when both are nonzero (or
 *     when desc.use_limits is set; see the desc). The clamp is on the
 *     rule's own level, so it does not accumulate: a staircase held at max
 *     leaves max on the first step away from it. desc.start is clamped the
 *     same way. A clamped step is still a step: YST_EVENT_STEP is
 *     reported, the direction changes, and the schedule advances on a
 *     reversal, even when the level did not move. A proposal sitting
 *     exactly on min or max for desc.stop_at_limit consecutive trials ends
 *     the staircase with YST_STOP_LIMIT, because a staircase stuck at max
 *     is an observer who cannot do the task, not a threshold. The count is
 *     of trials proposed at a limit, whether a clamp put the level there or
 *     the rule simply has not stepped away yet.
 *
 *   STOPPING (desc.stop_reversals, desc.stop_trials)
 *     Either or both. The staircase is done when the reversal count reaches
 *     stop_reversals, or the trial count reaches stop_trials, whichever is
 *     first; 0 disables a criterion, and open() rejects both zero.
 *     yst_stop_reason() says which fired. When more than one criterion
 *     comes true on the same trial the reason reported is the first of
 *     REVERSALS, TRIALS, LIMIT, FULL, and it never changes afterward.
 *     Trials the caller submits after done() is true are accepted and
 *     recorded; done() just keeps saying yes. YST_MAX_TRIALS (1024) is
 *     the hard ceiling: the staircase is done with YST_STOP_FULL once
 *     that many trials are recorded, and update() returns YST_ERR_FULL
 *     past it. YST_MAX_REVERSALS bounds stop_reversals, and
 *     YST_MAX_TRIALS bounds stop_trials, so open() rejects a criterion
 *     the handle could not reach. Reversals past YST_MAX_REVERSALS are
 *     still counted but their levels are not recorded.
 *
 *   REVERSALS
 *     A reversal is a change in the direction of the step. The level at
 *     which the direction changed (the last level before the turn, as the
 *     rule PROPOSED it) is what the reversal records, which is the
 *     convention of Levitt, Palamedes and PsychoPy. The first step has no
 *     direction to reverse from; a clamp at a limit that would have stepped
 *     past it counts as a step in the limit's direction.
 *
 *   ESTIMATES (yst_estimate)
 *     YST_EST_REVERSALS      mean of the last desc.est_reversals reversal
 *                              levels (default, est_reversals = 0: all
 *                              reversals after the step schedule was
 *                              exhausted, and excluding the first reversal
 *                              when the initial rule was on). Even counts
 *                              pair peaks with troughs; an odd count biases
 *                              toward one. Levitt's recommendation, and the
 *                              default. A nonzero est_reversals is a plain
 *                              "last N reversals" with neither exclusion.
 *     YST_EST_TRIALS         mean of the levels of the last est_trials
 *                              trials (default: every trial after the
 *                              schedule was exhausted).
 *     YST_EST_MEDIAN_REV     median of the same reversals as above, for a
 *                              staircase with an outlier reversal. An even
 *                              count averages the two middle levels.
 *     YST_EST_LAST           the level the rule would propose next, which
 *                              is yst_next(); what ASA reports.
 *     YST_EST_REVERSALS and YST_EST_MEDIAN_REV summarize the rule's own
 *     track, so they use the PROPOSED level at each turn. YST_EST_TRIALS
 *     summarizes what the observer saw, so it uses the SHOWN level the
 *     caller passed to update(). The two agree unless the caller showed
 *     something other than the proposal.
 *     Means are taken in the step's units: a LOG or DB staircase averages
 *     log levels and returns the antilog (the geometric mean). The estimate
 *     is a summary of the track, not a fit; for a fit with a slope and
 *     confidence intervals, replay the history through ysp/quest.h or fit
 *     it offline.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   RETURN VALUES AND ERRORS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yst_open() returns bool and fills yst_error() on failure. Every
 *   other function returns a value or a code and never touches the message
 *   buffer, matching the collection's convention. update() returns 0, or a
 *   positive YST_EVENT_* mask for a step or a reversal, or a negative
 *   YST_ERR_*. yst_strerror() names a code.
 *
 *     YST_ERR_ARG      null handle, response not 0 or 1, level not finite,
 *                        or a level <= 0 under YST_STEP_LOG / _DB
 *     YST_ERR_CLOSED   the handle was never opened
 *     YST_ERR_FULL     YST_MAX_TRIALS trials recorded
 *
 *   A closed handle answers every other call without touching it: next()
 *   and estimate() give NaN, estimate_count() and n_trials() give 0,
 *   history() gives NULL, done() and is_open() give false, stop_reason()
 *   gives YST_STOP_NONE, reversal_level() gives NaN and
 *   reversal_trial() gives -1. So does a null handle.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The handle holds everything inline: the full trial history
 *   (YST_MAX_TRIALS levels and responses), the reversal list
 *   (YST_MAX_REVERSALS) and the counters. About 28 KB at the defaults
 *   (28168 bytes on a 64-bit ABI).
 *   Nothing allocates, ever. Define YST_MAX_TRIALS or
 *   YST_MAX_REVERSALS before the include to resize both the handle and
 *   the ceilings. A handle is not thread-safe; one thread drives one
 *   staircase, and interleaved staircases on one thread are just several
 *   handles. Every function is deterministic: the same desc and the same
 *   history give the same proposals, so a saved history (yst_history())
 *   replayed through yst_update() restores the state exactly.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SIMULATION
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yst_simulate_response(p_correct, u) returns 1 when u < p_correct and
 *   0 otherwise; u is a uniform variate in [0, 1) that the caller draws.
 *   The header has no random generator, so an example's seed policy is the
 *   example's. examples/stair_sim.c runs a 3-down-1-up against a Weibull
 *   observer and prints the track and the estimate against the truth.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Nothing to link but libm (-lm on Linux when not using a C++ driver).
 *   Define YST_API to override the default `extern` linkage; it is on the
 *   definitions too, so -DYST_API=static gives one translation unit a
 *   private copy.
 *
 *       cc -O2 -Iinclude -o stair_sim examples/stair_sim.c -lm
