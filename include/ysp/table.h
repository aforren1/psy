/* ysp/table.h - v0.1.0 - public domain single-header typed tables
 *
 *   A table of rows and named, typed columns, as one read-only block of
 *   bytes: conditions files, trial lists, event lists. A CSV parser with
 *   stated bounds and a number syntax that no locale can change writes the
 *   block into the caller's memory; the pack stores the same bytes, and a
 *   view checks them and reads them in place. ysp/trials.h takes a table
 *   as its conditions (desc.table); the pack tool and ysp/timeline.h read
 *   tables through this header too.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no heap, no OS calls, no threads, and no file I/O unless
 *   YTB_STDIO is defined. Needs only the C standard library (snprintf,
 *   ldexp). Targets every platform the compiler does; C99 is the floor: it
 *   builds as C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by
 *   default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.1.0 - first version, split out of the ysp/trials.h v0.2 design so
 *          the pack tool and ysp/timeline.h can read the same tables: the
 *          CSV parser, the block format (1), the view and its checks, the
 *          number parser, the lookups, the opt-in file loader.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.1.0, 2026-10-07. Built and run on Windows 11 with MinGW-w64
 *   gcc 16.1 as C11, C99 and C++17 under -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow
 *   -Werror and with MSVC 19.44 under /W4 /WX, in its default C dialect
 *   and as /std:c++17; on Linux (WSL2) with gcc 11.4 as C11 and C++17
 *   under -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all with no
 *   diagnostic. tests/adapt/table_test.c checks ytb_parse_number()
 *   against strtod() in the C locale bit for bit: 10,000,084 strings
 *   (exact halfway points and their neighbors, round trips of random
 *   doubles and subnormals, the range ends, the 19-digit limit) with 0
 *   disagreements on gcc (mingw-w64 strtod) and on MSVC (UCRT), 200,084 on
 *   Linux (glibc); again after switching to a decimal-comma locale
 *   (Windows). Every dialect rule and bound of CSV with its line, row and
 *   column; the block's hash pinned across compilers; every single-bit
 *   flip and truncation of a block refused; structural faults behind a
 *   valid hash refused by name. The Python binding of ysp/trials.h
 *   compares the parser with Python's csv module (40 random files) and
 *   float() (5000 values): all equal. Fuzzed (tests/fuzz/table_fuzz.c)
 *   under MSVC libFuzzer with ASan: 5,906,077 inputs in 1351 s, no crash;
 *   the 958 corpus files replayed on Linux under ASan and UBSan with no
 *   report. Mutations: 25 in tests/mutate/table.toml, 24 killed, 1
 *   equivalent. Costs measured (Iris Xe laptop, AC, measurement lock,
 *   examples/trials/bench.c, 21 rounds, medians, gcc 16.1 -O2 / MSVC 19.44
 *   /O2) on 10,000 rows x 8 columns: parse 181 / 188 MB/s for words,
 *   170 / 97 MB/s for %.17g numbers, 200 / 218 MB/s with 30 % quoted
 *   fields; ytb_view() of the 2 to 3 MB blocks 0.26 to 0.38 / 0.21 to
 *   0.31 ms. docs/table.md has the tables.
 *   What is NOT done: no run on macOS or a big-endian host (parse and view
 *   refuse there); the hash detects corruption, not forgery.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_TABLE_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header to create the
 *   implementation. Every other file just includes the header normally.
 *   ysp/trials.h's implementation includes this one's (as ysp/gfx.h does
 *   ysp/color.h's), so a program that defines YSP_TRIALS_IMPLEMENTATION
 *   does not define YSP_TABLE_IMPLEMENTATION in another file.
 *
 *   A conditions file:
 *
 *       target,contrast,word
 *       a,0.25,cat
 *       a,0.5,"dog, big"
 *       b,0.25,ox
 *
 *       static uint64_t arena[1 << 17];          // 1 MB, 8-byte aligned
 *       ytb_table tab;
 *       ytb_csv_desc cd = { .text = csv, .len = csv_len,
 *                             .arena = arena, .arena_size = sizeof arena };
 *       if (!ytb_csv(&tab, &cd)) { fputs(ytb_error(&tab), stderr); return 1; }
 *       // "ysp_table: line 13, row 12, column 'contrast' (2): '0,5' is not
 *       //  a number; the decimal separator is '.'"
 *
 *       int contrast = ytb_col(&tab, "contrast");    // once, not per trial
 *       double c = ytb_num(&tab, row, contrast);      // 0.25
 *       const char* w = ytb_text(&tab, row, ytb_col(&tab, "word"));
 *
 *   The block is position-independent, so it can be saved and mapped back:
 *
 *       fwrite(tab.base, 1, tab.size, f);              // the pack tool
 *       ...
 *       ytb_table t2;
 *       if (!ytb_view(&t2, bytes, len)) fputs(ytb_error(&t2), stderr);
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A table has n_rows rows (data rows; the header line is not one) and
 *   n_cols columns, each with a name and a type:
 *     YTB_INTEGER   int32
 *     YTB_NUMBER    double
 *     YTB_STRING    UTF-8 text
 *   Every column is also categorical: its LEVELS are its distinct values,
 *   numbered from 0 in order of first appearance. A cell stores its level
 *   (16 bits); a level stores its text as first written and its value.
 *   Numeric cells are equal when their values are: "0.5" and "0.50" are one
 *   level, whose text is "0.5" if that came first, and -0 and 0 are one
 *   level. A data file written from the table therefore shows numbers as
 *   the conditions file wrote them, not as printf would.
 *   Lookups: ytb_col() by name, ytb_level() / ytb_text() /
 *   ytb_num() / ytb_int() by row and column, ytb_level_text() and
 *   ytb_level_num() by level, ytb_find() for the level of a value text
 *   (bytes for a STRING column, value for a numeric one, so find(contrast,
 *   "0.50") finds the level written "0.5"), ytb_n_levels(),
 *   ytb_level_bytes() for a hot loop (n_rows little-endian uint16 level
 *   numbers), ytb_hash() for the block's content hash (a log line can
 *   name the exact conditions file with it). A bad row, column or level
 *   gives -1, NULL, NaN or INT32_MIN, as each declaration says.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CSV DIALECT
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   RFC 4180, with these rules stated:
 *     encoding    UTF-8; a leading byte order mark is skipped; any invalid
 *                 UTF-8 (overlong forms, surrogates, above U+10FFFF) or a
 *                 NUL byte is an error. A Latin-1 export from a
 *                 spreadsheet fails here instead of corrupting text.
 *     records     end with CRLF or LF; the last may have no line end; a CR
 *                 outside quotes that is not followed by LF is an error.
 *     delimiter   ',' (desc.delimiter 0), or ';' or a tab.
 *     header      the first record. Each name is a letter or '_', then
 *                 letters, digits or '_', at most YTB_MAX_NAME (63)
 *                 bytes, unique (case-sensitive); PsychoPy asks the same
 *                 of a conditions file.
 *     fields      not trimmed: spaces are data. A field that starts with a
 *                 quote is quoted: inside, "" is a quote, and delimiters,
 *                 CR and LF are data; after the closing quote only a
 *                 delimiter or a record end may follow. A quote inside an
 *                 unquoted field is an error.
 *     shape       every record has the header's number of fields. A record
 *                 whose fields are all empty (spreadsheets write ",,,,"
 *                 rows; an empty line is one) is skipped and counted in
 *                 n_skipped.
 *     empty cell  the level "" of a STRING column. In an INTEGER or NUMBER
 *                 column it is an error, unless desc.allow_empty, which
 *                 makes it NaN (one level, text "") and the column NUMBER.
 *     not taken   comments, a type row, decimal commas, thousands
 *                 separators, hex, inf, nan, n/a, spaces around numbers,
 *                 other encodings.
 *   BOUNDS, each an error that names the line, row and column:
 *     YTB_MAX_COLUMNS (64) columns, YTB_MAX_ROWS (32767) data rows
 *     (row and level numbers are 16-bit), YTB_MAX_FIELD (4096) bytes in
 *     a field after unquoting, 2 GiB of input.
 *   TYPES. A column named in desc.types[] has that type and each of its
 *   cells must parse as it. Any other column is INTEGER when every
 *   non-empty cell is an integer in int32, else NUMBER when every non-empty
 *   cell is a number (one out of range or with too many digits counts, so
 *   that cell is reported rather than the column turning into text), else
 *   STRING; a column with no non-empty cell is STRING. Declare STRING for
 *   codes such as "007" that must keep their text: inferred, "007" is the
 *   integer 7 (its level text stays "007").
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   NUMBERS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The syntax, and nothing else:
 *       integer = [+|-] digit {digit}                       (fits int32)
 *       number  = [+|-] ( digits [ "." {digit} ] | "." digits )
 *                 [ (e|E) [+|-] digits ]
 *   At most YTB_MAX_DIGITS (19) significant digits, counted from the
 *   first nonzero digit to the last nonzero one (pandas and spreadsheets
 *   write at most 17). More is YTB_NUM_DIGITS. A value whose magnitude
 *   rounds above the largest double, or a nonzero value that rounds to 0,
 *   is YTB_NUM_RANGE; subnormals are kept. The conversion is correctly
 *   rounded, ties to even, and reads no locale: Clinger's fast path when
 *   the digits fit 2^53 and the exponent is within 22, else exact big
 *   integers (M x 5^E rounded to 53 bits; or M 2^s divided by 5^-E by
 *   restoring division, the remainder as the sticky bit, subnormals rounded
 *   at their own bit). ytb_parse_number() and ytb_parse_int() are the
 *   parser on its own.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   THE BLOCK (format 1)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Little-endian, every section 8-byte aligned, every offset from the
 *   block's start, so the bytes are valid wherever they are mapped:
 *     header   48 bytes: "PSTB", u32 format (1), u32 n_rows, u32 n_cols,
 *              u32 n_skipped, u32 flags (0), u64 size, u64 hash, u64
 *              pool_off (where the text pool starts).
 *     columns  n_cols x 32 bytes: u32 name_off, u32 name_len, u32 type,
 *              u32 n_levels, u64 rows_off, u64 levels_off.
 *     rows     per column, n_rows u16 level numbers at rows_off.
 *     levels   per column, n_levels x 16 bytes at levels_off: u32
 *              text_off, u32 text_len, f64 value (the number for INTEGER
 *              and NUMBER, NaN for an empty cell, 0 for STRING).
 *     pool     from pool_off to size: UTF-8 strings, each followed by a
 *              NUL, so a text is a C string in place; zero padding to 8.
 *   The hash: over the block's little-endian 64-bit words, with word 4 (the
 *   hash itself) read as 0, four lanes over words i, i+1, i+2, i+3 (lane
 *   k starts at size + k; each word w: h = (h ^ w) * 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15,
 *   h ^= h >> 29), the words past the last full group of four into lane 0;
 *   then h0 ^ h1 * 0xC2B2AE3D27D4EB4F ^ h2 * 0x165667B19E3779F9 ^
 *   h3 * 0xD6E8FEB86659FD93, folded (x ^= x >> 32; x *= 0xD6E8FEB86659FD93;
 *   x ^= x >> 32). Not cryptographic: it finds corruption, not forgery.
 *   The parse writes the columns, then every column's rows, then every
 *   column's levels, then the pool, in that order, so the same input gives
 *   the same bytes on every compiler and platform.
 *   ytb_view() refuses a block (with a message) unless: the magic,
 *   format and flags are right; size fits the bytes given and the hash
 *   matches; the counts are in bounds; every offset and length is inside
 *   the block and aligned; the pool is valid UTF-8 (NULs between texts);
 *   every name and text lies in the pool and ends with a NUL (a text is
 *   its bytes up to its first NUL);
 *   every name is a valid, unique name; every row's level is below its
 *   column's n_levels and n_levels is at most n_rows; every INTEGER value is
 *   integral in int32. O(cells + text). A
 *   big-endian host refuses to parse or view: the block is little-endian
 *   by definition and no supported platform is big-endian.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ERRORS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ytb_csv() and ytb_view() return false and fill ytb_error(), and
 *   for a parse err_line, err_row and err_col (1-based; 0 when not
 *   applicable, row 0 being the header): "ysp_table: line L, row R, column
 *   'name' (C): what". The line is the one the record starts on, which a
 *   quoted line break makes differ from row + 1. On a failure the view is
 *   empty (base NULL, no rows).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND COST
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Nothing allocates. ytb_csv() writes the block at the start of
 *   desc.arena (8-byte aligned) and uses the space after it as scratch: an
 *   8-byte entry per cell (at the arena's top, written while scanning), the
 *   unquoted text, and a hash table per column in turn. tab.need is set
 *   once the input is scanned (with arena NULL the call only sets it): about
 *   24 bytes per cell plus three times the input. The finished block is
 *   tab.size bytes, 2 bytes per cell plus 16 per level plus the text; the
 *   arena space after it is free again. Two passes over the input (scan,
 *   then write a column at a time).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   FILE LOADER (YTB_STDIO)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   With YTB_STDIO defined before the implementation, ytb_csv_file()
 *   reads a file into the top of desc.arena and parses it with the rest.
 *   The path is UTF-8 on every platform (on Windows it is converted to
 *   UTF-16 for _wfopen, so a path with accents works). Off by default: the
 *   header otherwise touches no file.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Nothing to link but the math library. Define YTB_API to override the
 *   default `extern` linkage.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
