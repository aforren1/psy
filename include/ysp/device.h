/* ysp/device.h - v0.2.1 - public domain single-header device layer
 *
 *   A response box, a trigger box or a microcontroller board as a producer
 *   of ysp/input.h events with times on the ysp_rt clock, and as a target
 *   for output codes (TTL triggers): one instance per physical device, each
 *   with its own reader thread, a decoder and encoders from ysp/box.h, a
 *   device clock fit from ysp/rt.h, timer queries for bracketed pairs,
 *   identity (a match key and the device's own answer), roles, and a
 *   lifecycle that survives an unplug: the device is found again by its
 *   key, the fit restarts, and the gap is in the log. Every output write
 *   is a record with the times before and after it.
 *   docs/devices_spec.md is the plan; this is its steps 2 and 3.
 *
 *   REQUIRES ysp/rt.h, ysp/input.h, ysp/box.h and ysp/serial.h beside it;
 *   this header includes them, and its implementation implements ysp/rt.h,
 *   ysp/box.h and ysp/serial.h unless the translation unit already does.
 *   Windows, Linux and macOS. C99 is the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and
 *   C++17.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.2.1 - Builds with YRT_NO_THREADS again (v0.2.0 refused it): no
 *          trailing-edge worker there, so a host-timed pulse ends in
 *          ydev_poll(), as on a device with desc.now.
 *   v0.2.0 - Outputs: ydev_out_set(), ydev_out_pulse(), ydev_out_mark(),
 *          ydev_out_trigger() and the YDEV_REC_OUT record; the output
 *          families of ysp/box.h v0.2.0 (TriggerBox, BioSemi, MMBT-S, DTR
 *          and RTS, the parallel port, XID and line-protocol outputs);
 *          host-timed trailing edges on a ysp/rt.h worker; the
 *          ysp/screen.h trigger channel (ydev_trigger_fn); roles
 *          (ydev_roles, desc.roles); transport.lines; a transport without
 *          read. Inputs unchanged.
 *   v0.1.0 - first version: XID, ysp line protocol and photodiode frame
 *          devices on the serial transport (or the caller's), a reader
 *          thread or manual polling, BRACKET fits with timer queries,
 *          match keys, identify, reconnect, records in a ysp/rt.h ring.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.2.0, 2026-10-08. Built with MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX, C11 and
 *   C++17), MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 and gcc 11.4 on WSL2 (C99, C11, C++17,
 *   -Werror). tests/adapt/device_test.c runs simulated devices through a
 *   fake transport on a virtual clock (manual mode) and on a real thread:
 *   identify, events mapped through the fit, timer queries and their
 *   widths, an unplug with a clock reset (LOST, the gap record, the fit
 *   restarted, RUNNING again), silence, a wrong device, the match keys;
 *   and the outputs: the bytes and lines of each family, the OUT records,
 *   trailing edges on the worker (timed on the real clock), the trigger
 *   channel with a fake flip, roles. tests/loopback/device_loopback.c runs
 *   the serial transport against a socat pty pair on WSL2;
 *   examples/device/out_latency.c measures write to edge on a simulated
 *   adapter and board. NO REAL DEVICE has been opened: no box, board or
 *   trigger interface was attached. docs/device.md has the numbers.

 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MATCH KEYS (desc.key)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A key names a physical device so that it is found again after a
 *   replug and a reboot, whatever port name the OS gives it:
 *     serial:<vid>:<pid>:<serial>:<location>
 *   vid and pid in hex, the USB serial number and the port's location as
 *   ysp/serial.h lists them (yser_port_info). In a desc.key an empty or
 *   missing field matches anything, case-insensitively:
 *   "serial:16C0:0483::" is any Teensy in serial mode, "serial:0403:6001:
 *   FT4ABC12" one FTDI cable by its serial number. Cedrus ships FTDI's
 *   default vid and pid, so an XID box needs its serial number to be told
 *   from another FTDI cable. "port:COM5" or "port:/dev/ttyACM0" names a
 *   port instead, which a replug can change. ydev_port_key() writes the
 *   key of a listed port; ydev_key_match() is the rule.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   LIFECYCLE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *     OPENING  looking for the key; every retry_ns (1 s) until it opens
 *     RUNNING  identified, reading
 *     LOST     the transport failed (unplugged) or nothing arrived for
 *              silent_ns (2 s); reopened by key every retry_ns
 *     FAILED   the device at the key did not answer as the family must
 *              (identify): a wrong device. No retry; stop and start again
 *     CLOSED   stopped
 *   IDENTIFY. XID: "_c1" must answer "_xid0" (a box in another mode is
 *   switched to XID mode with "c10", as pyxid2 does, and the log says so),
 *   then "_d2", "_d3", "_d4" give the product, model and firmware. LINE:
 *   "i" must answer an "I" line within 1.5 s (asked three times, for a
 *   board that resets when the port opens). PHOTO: none. desc.no_identify
 *   skips it.
 *   Each open starts a new fit: a device's clock can reset on power-up.
 *   Events of a LOST interval are lost; the GAP record gives the last time
 *   a byte arrived before and the time the device ran again.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TIME
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Every frame that carries the device's time is a pair for ysp/rt.h's
 *   fit in BRACKET mode: a frame the device sent on its own has width 0 (it
 *   is late, never early), and the answer to a timer query sent at t0 and
 *   read at t1 has width t1 - t0. Queries go every probe_ns (100 ms): the
 *   fit then has pairs between a box's rare presses (docs/rt.md: sparse
 *   presses behind a 16 ms latency timer gave millisecond errors for
 *   minutes). Brackets wider than max_width_ns are refused: 1.3 ms for
 *   LINE (native USB), 20 ms for XID, whose answers wait in the FTDI
 *   chip's latency timer (16 ms by default). An XID query writes "_e", waits
 *   1 ms and stamps t0 before the "5" the box answers. Each event's t is
 *   the fit's map of its device time, never later than its read time (a
 *   map past it is clamped and counted); unc_us is the device's tick plus
 *   the widest bracket the map rests on (without brackets, the fit's
 *   spread): a bound from the fit's own evidence, not a measurement; ticks
 *   holds the device time. Before the first pair maps, t is the read
 *   time. The fit's own CLOCK and FIT records go to desc.ring with
 *   clock_id = desc.device.
 *   ydev_source() gives the source entry: tier UNKNOWN, because no loopback
 *   has checked any device on this layer (docs/devices_spec.md, 12).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   THREADS, MANUAL MODE AND RECORDS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ydev_start() starts one reader thread for the instance, elevated with
 *   yrt_thread_elevate() unless desc.no_elevate. It blocks in the
 *   transport's read for at most read_timeout_ms (20 ms) and calls
 *   desc.sink on that thread for each event: a sink must be quick and
 *   thread-safe; yscr_push_input() is. ydev_stop() asks the transport to
 *   interrupt, joins the thread and closes the port.
 *   desc.manual: no thread. The caller calls ydev_poll() (one step: open,
 *   identify, read, decode, sink) from its own loop. With desc.now the
 *   instance reads that clock instead of yrt_now_ns() and does not wait
 *   the 1 ms between XID bytes: for tests and replays.
 *   desc.ring gets records of source YRT_SRC_DEVICE, aux = desc.device:
 *   YDEV_REC_STATE (u32[0] old, u32[1] new state, u32[2] YDEV_WHY_*,
 *   u32[3] the instance's open count), YDEV_REC_GAP (i64[0] the last byte
 *   before the loss, i64[1] running again), YDEV_REC_TEXT (39 characters:
 *   "role ...", "port ...", "ident ..."), YDEV_REC_GARBAGE (u64[0] the
 *   decoder's total, at most one a second).
 *   Nothing allocates after ydev_start(); the instance holds its buffers
 *   and the fit (about 45 KB: make it static or allocate it once).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   OUTPUTS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   An instance of a family with outputs (ybox_caps() & YBOX_CAP_OUT)
 *   takes codes from any thread once it is RUNNING:
 *     ydev_out_set(dev, code)               hold code (0 is idle)
 *     ydev_out_pulse(dev, code, width_ns)   code, then 0 after width_ns
 *     ydev_out_mark(dev, code, text)        the code as desc.pulse_ns says
 *                                           (a pulse, or a set when 0) and
 *                                           the text in the log
 *     ydev_out_trigger(dev, code, deadline) the same for a ysp/screen.h
 *                                           trigger channel (AT THE FLIP)
 *   Each returns YDEV_OK or a YDEV_ERR_*: STATE when the device is not
 *   RUNNING (nothing is written), ARG for a code above ybox_code_max() or
 *   a width the family cannot give, IO when the write failed (the reader
 *   then finds the device LOST). Each call, failed or not, is one
 *   YDEV_REC_OUT record. Who times a pulse's end:
 *     the device     XID ("mp" then "mh"; the width in whole ms, sent only
 *                    when it changes) and LINE ("p <code> <us>"): flag
 *                    DEVICE_TIMED; no second write
 *     fixed          BioSemi and MMBT-S at switch P end every code after
 *                    8 ms by themselves: width_ns must be 0 or within 1 ms
 *                    of it; a set is that pulse too
 *     the host       TriggerBox, MMBT-S at switch S (desc.latched), DTR and
 *                    RTS, the parallel port: the instance's own ysp/rt.h
 *                    worker (elevated unless desc.no_elevate) writes 0 at
 *                    the deadline taken after the leading write. Its
 *                    record (TRAILING) gives that write's own times
 *   yser_pulse_async() and ypar_pulse_async() are not used: they give no
 *   time for the trailing write and know no modem lines. The worker keeps
 *   one trailing edge: a pulse while one is pending moves it (REPLACED); a
 *   set cancels it, because a set means "hold this". ydev_stop() writes a
 *   pending trailing edge at once (FLUSHED), then 0 if a code is still
 *   held, then the family's close bytes (TriggerBox 0xFF), then closes.
 *   With desc.now (a virtual clock) there is no worker: ydev_poll() writes
 *   a trailing edge that is due.
 *   Opening: DTR and RTS start low (the port is opened with
 *   dtr_low_on_open and rts_low_on_open); the TriggerBox, MMBT-S, LINES and
 *   parallel outputs get one 0 after they open. desc.baud 0 is the
 *   family's rate (ybox_default_baud(): 9600 for the MMBT-S).
 *   Writes are serialized with the reader's timer queries under the
 *   instance's output lock; an XID query writes its 3 bytes 1 ms apart, so
 *   an output on an XID instance with queries can wait up to 2 ms
 *   (desc.probe_ns < 0 turns the queries off). Output commands are written
 *   whole: Cedrus says XID 2 devices need no gap between bytes.
 *   LINE boards report each change of their outputs ("O <t> <code>"): the
 *   reader maps t through the fit and writes a REPORTED record, the
 *   board's own time of the pin change.
 *   YDEV_REC_OUT: t_ns = i64[0]; i64[0] the time just before the write
 *   (REPORTED: the mapped board time), i64[1] just after (REPORTED: the read
 *   time), i64[2] the width (the device's or the requested one; TRAILING:
 *   the host width between the two writes), i64[3] the flip deadline (FLIP)
 *   or the board ticks (REPORTED), u32[8] the code, u16[18] the YDEV_OUT_*
 *   flags, u16[19] the output's number (a pulse and its TRAILING record
 *   share it). MARK text follows as TEXT records "mark <text>", 34
 *   characters each. ydev_out_last() gives the last call's times.
 *   No output has a tier yet: write to edge is a loopback measurement
 *   (docs/devices_spec.md 12; examples/device/out_latency.c).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   AT THE FLIP (ysp/screen.h)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Include ysp/screen.h before this header (or include this header again
 *   after it) and the device layer supplies the trigger channel callback;
 *   its context is the output instance:
 *       yscr_trigger_desc ch[1];
 *       ch[0] = ydev_trigger_channel(&trig, 0);     // fn, ctx, offset, name
 *       sd.triggers = ch; sd.n_triggers = 1;
 *       ... yscr_trigger(screen, 0, 12);            // at this flip's vblank
 *   ydev_trigger_fn() runs on the screen's trigger worker at the planned
 *   vblank and calls ydev_out_trigger() with the code and the deadline: a
 *   pulse of desc.pulse_ns (a set when 0), recorded with FLIP and the
 *   deadline, so deadline to write is in the log. A flush at the screen's
 *   close writes nothing (TRIGGERS: "a callback should not pulse then").
 *   No second scheduler: the screen's worker is the clock.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ROLES
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A role is the experiment's name for an instance ("resp", "trig"). With
 *   desc.roles (a ydev_roles table the caller owns, zeroed once) and
 *   desc.device 0, ydev_start() gives the instance the role's index, 1 to
 *   YDEV_MAX_ROLES: the yin_event.device of its events and the aux of its
 *   records, so the data file joins them by role. A role keeps its index
 *   across a stop and a start; two running instances cannot share a role.
 *   ydev_role_index(), ydev_role_device() and ydev_role_name() look roles
 *   up, so a timeline's "trigger trig 12" finds its output by name. Start
 *   and stop instances from one thread; the lookups are safe while no
 *   start or stop runs.
 *
