/* ysp/parallel.h - v0.3 - public domain single-header parallel-port library
 *
 *   A small C library for reading and writing the PC parallel port (LPT).
 *   Built for low-latency 8-bit trigger output of the kind used in
 *   psychophysics / EEG / electrophysiology rigs, where a byte written to
 *   the data lines is latched onto a recording system.
 *
 *   Inspired by:
 *     - pyparallel    (https://github.com/pyparallel/pyparallel)
 *     - ppdev-mex     (https://github.com/widmann/ppdev-mex)
 *   and written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries.
 *
 *   REQUIRES ysp/rt.h, its sibling in this repository, beside it. That
 *   header owns the clock, the waits, the scheduling ladder and the
 *   trailing-edge worker; this one owns the port. Copy BOTH files (the
 *   stb_truetype / stb_rect_pack arrangement). Nothing else is needed: the
 *   pair still depends on nothing but the OS.
 *
 *   Targets Windows and Linux. C99 is the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and
 *   C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.3 - Depends on ysp/rt.h, and its own copies of the monotonic clock,
 *          the sleep-until, the SCHED_DEADLINE/FIFO ladder, the Windows
 *          waitable timers and the worker thread are gone. All three ysp
 *          headers now time against one implementation instead of three.
 *          ypar_sched_deadline is a typedef of yrt_sched_deadline and
 *          ypar_async_policy of yrt_policy. The YPAR_ASYNC_* and
 *          YPAR_DEFAULT_RT_* names survive as aliases, but the policy
 *          VALUES changed: yrt_policy carries a macOS rung
 *          (YRT_POLICY_TIME_CONSTRAINT = 2) that this header never
 *          returns, so FIFO, TIME_CRITICAL and NORMAL each moved up by one.
 *          Code comparing names is unaffected; code that stored, indexed or
 *          wire-formatted the integers must be rebuilt. YPAR_NO_THREADS now
 *          implies YRT_NO_THREADS. ypar_open() validates desc.sched on
 *          Windows too, where it used to be ignored.
 *          On YPAR_BACKEND_DIRECT the worker thread's own ioperm()/iopl()
 *          grant runs from yrt_worker_desc.on_start (ysp/rt.h v0.2), which
 *          executes on the worker thread before yrt_worker_start()
 *          returns. A refused grant therefore fails ypar_open() as it did in
 *          v0.2, instead of waiting to show up as async_write_failed on the
 *          first trailing edge. (An earlier v0.3 draft, before ysp/rt.h had
 *          that hook, did the latter.)
 *   v0.2 - ypar_open() forces the data direction to forward on every
 *          backend, so a port left in reverse mode by a previous client no
 *          longer makes every trigger float. New ypar_desc.dll_path lets a
 *          binding name the inpout DLL explicitly (the loader searches the
 *          EXECUTABLE's directory, which is python.exe or MATLAB for the
 *          bindings). New ypar_port.async_write_failed reports a failed
 *          trailing-edge write from the async worker. The DIRECT backend's
 *          per-thread I/O permission is now granted on the worker thread
 *          itself, and the per-thread rules are documented. Windows creates
 *          ypar_pulse()'s waitable timer in ypar_open(), not on first pulse.
 *   v0.1 - first release.

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Copy TWO files into your project, ysp/parallel.h and ysp/rt.h, and keep
 *   them in one ysp/ directory whose parent is on the include path (this
 *   header includes "ysp/rt.h"). Then do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_PARALLEL_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header to create the
 *   implementation. Every other file just includes the header normally.
 *   That one file also creates ysp/rt.h's implementation, unless the
 *   translation unit already has it; you never need to define
 *   YSP_RT_IMPLEMENTATION for this header's sake, and defining it anyway
 *   (or implementing ysp/serial.h in the same file) still yields exactly
 *   one copy.
 *
 *       #define YSP_PARALLEL_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       #include "ysp/parallel.h"
 *
 *       ypar_port pp;
 *       ypar_desc desc = {0};                         // sensible defaults
 *       if (!ypar_open(&pp, &desc)) {
 *           fprintf(stderr, "open failed: %s\n", ypar_error(&pp));
 *           return 1;
 *       }
 *       ypar_write_data(&pp, 0x55);                   // raise a trigger
 *       ypar_pulse(&pp, 0x55, 2000);                  // 0x55 for 2 ms, then 0
 *       ypar_close(&pp);
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BACKENDS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Linux:
 *     YPAR_BACKEND_PPDEV   - the kernel ppdev character device
 *                            (/dev/parport0). The portable, recommended
 *                            path. Setup, once:
 *                              sudo modprobe ppdev        # creates /dev/parportN
 *                              sudo usermod -aG lp $USER  # device access; re-login
 *                            (add `ppdev` to /etc/modules-load.d/ to keep
 *                            it across reboots.) "No such file or directory"
 *                            on open almost always means ppdev is not
 *                            loaded. The `lp` printer driver only holds the
 *                            port while printing; unloading it is rarely
 *                            needed. NOTE: claiming the port (PPCLAIM)
 *                            BLOCKS until the port is free, it does not
 *                            fail. If another process holds it, ypar_open()
 *                            hangs; find the holder with
 *                            `lsof /dev/parport0` before you open.
 *     YPAR_BACKEND_DIRECT  - raw x86 port I/O via outb/inb. Lowest latency,
 *                            but requires root (CAP_SYS_RAWIO) and
 *                            x86/x86_64. You must know the I/O base address
 *                            (/proc/ioports). Legacy ISA bases below 0x400
 *                            use ioperm(), scoped to the 3 registers. PCI/
 *                            PCIe cards live above 0x400, where ioperm()
 *                            cannot reach, so the library uses iopl(3)
 *                            there, which grants the process EVERY I/O
 *                            port; a wrong base address then writes to
 *                            whatever device owns it.
 *
 *   DIRECT IS PER-THREAD. ioperm() and iopl() grant I/O permission to the
 *   CALLING THREAD only, not to the process. With YPAR_BACKEND_DIRECT a
 *   handle is therefore usable from two threads and no others: the thread
 *   that called ypar_open(), and the ysp/rt.h worker thread ypar_open()
 *   started. The worker grants itself permission on its own thread, from
 *   yrt_worker_desc.on_start, which runs there before yrt_worker_start()
 *   returns; so it is safe wherever it was started from, and a REFUSED grant
 *   fails ypar_open() rather than one trigger's trailing edge much later.
 *   outb/inb from any other thread raises
 *   SIGSEGV; there is no error return to check. Call ypar_open(),
 *   ypar_write_data(), ypar_pulse() and the register accessors from one
 *   thread, and use ypar_pulse_async() when you need a trailing edge issued
 *   from elsewhere. This matters most for the Python and MEX bindings, which
 *   are called from whatever thread the host runtime provides: prefer
 *   YPAR_BACKEND_PPDEV there, whose file descriptor is process-wide.
 *
 *   Closing a DIRECT handle revokes I/O permission for the whole thread, not
 *   just for that handle's 3 registers when iopl() was used, and ioperm()
 *   ranges of two handles may overlap. If you open several DIRECT handles on
 *   one thread, closing any of them can leave the others unable to write.
 *   Open one DIRECT handle per thread, or close them all together.
 *
 *   Windows (UNTESTED - compiled in CI but not run on real hardware; see
 *   parallel64 https://github.com/tekktrik/parallel64 for a maintained,
 *   Windows-focused alternative):
 *     YPAR_BACKEND_INPOUT  - loads inpout32.dll / inpoutx64.dll at runtime
 *                            (https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/inpout32/)
 *                            and calls its Out32/Inp32 entry points. Modern
 *                            Windows forbids user-mode port I/O, so a kernel
 *                            helper driver such as InpOut is required. The
 *                            DLL self-installs its driver on first use and
 *                            needs administrator rights to do so. Find the
 *                            port's I/O base address in Device Manager (the
 *                            LPT port, then Resources) and pass it as
 *                            desc.base_addr. NOTHING validates that address:
 *                            inpout writes to whatever port you name, and
 *                            0x64 (keyboard controller) or 0xCF8 (PCI
 *                            config) from a typo can hang the machine. The
 *                            DLL is loaded with the CWD excluded from the
 *                            search path, so put it next to the EXECUTABLE
 *                            or in System32, or pass its full path in
 *                            ypar_desc.dll_path. The executable is not
 *                            always yours: under the Python or MEX bindings
 *                            it is python.exe or MATLAB, so a DLL shipped
 *                            beside the binding module is found only via
 *                            dll_path.
 *
 *     Caveat: InpOut is an unmaintained, legacy-signed kernel driver that
 *     grants ring-0 port I/O. On hardened systems (Secure Boot with Memory
 *     Integrity enabled, or the Windows vulnerable-driver blocklist) it may
 *     be refused no matter how it is installed, and there is no maintained
 *     drop-in replacement.
 *
 *     What IS exercised on Windows is the timing underneath: since v0.3 the
 *     waits and the trailing-edge worker are ysp/rt.h's, and
 *     examples/rt_jitter.c measures those on Windows 11. The register writes
 *     on top of them are the part that has never reached hardware.
 *
 *   Trigger use needs a real PCIe/PCI parallel-port card or an onboard LPT.
 *   USB-to-parallel *printer* adapters do not expose a register-level I/O
 *   port on any platform.
 *
 *   YPAR_BACKEND_DEFAULT picks ppdev on Linux and inpout on Windows.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   REGISTER MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A standard (SPP) parallel port exposes three byte-wide registers at
 *   consecutive I/O addresses, base+0/+1/+2:
 *
 *     Data    (base+0, R/W) 8 output bits -> pins 2..9. The trigger byte.
 *     Status  (base+1, R)   5 input bits  -> pins 15,13,12,10,11.
 *     Control (base+2, R/W) 4 output bits -> pins 1,14,16,17 + dir bit.
 *
 *   Some pins are inverted in hardware relative to their register bit
 *   (Busy, nStrobe, nAutoFeed, nSelectIn). This library returns/accepts the
 *   raw register bits, matching pyparallel; use the YPAR_STATUS_* and
 *   YPAR_CONTROL_* masks and mind the hardware inversion noted below.
 *
 *   ypar_open() forces the data direction to forward (output) on every
 *   backend: PPDATADIR 0 on ppdev, YPAR_CONTROL_DIR cleared on direct and
 *   inpout. A bidirectional port left in reverse mode by a previous client
 *   tri-states the data pins, so every trigger byte would float instead of
 *   driving the recorder. Call ypar_set_data_dir(p, true) afterwards if you
 *   really want to read the data lines.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PULSES AND TIMING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Every wait, every clock read and every scheduling decision here belongs
 *   to ysp/rt.h. Its WAITS and SCHEDULING sections are the reference for
 *   what each one costs and what it is worth, and examples/rt_jitter.c
 *   measures the waits on YOUR rig rather than asserting a number. Pulse
 *   deadlines are yrt_now_ns() times, so a pulse timestamp and a
 *   yrt_now_us() or yser_now_us() timestamp taken in the same process
 *   subtract directly.
 *
 *   ypar_pulse(p, value, usec) writes value, waits until an absolute
 *   deadline taken right after that write, then writes 0. The wait is
 *   yrt_sleep_until() with YRT_DEFAULT_SPIN_NS: the OS gets the bulk of
 *   the width and the last spin window is spun on the clock (about 1.2 ms
 *   on Windows, where even the high-resolution waitable timer can fire that
 *   late, and 200 us on Linux; ysp/rt.h WAITS says why the two differ).
 *   It blocks the calling thread for the whole width, and that thread is
 *   whatever the caller has, at whatever priority the caller runs: no
 *   reservation, no elevated priority, preemptible by anything. Its
 *   trailing edge is therefore LESS precise than ypar_pulse_async's, which
 *   spins the same window on a thread that climbed the ladder. Same wait,
 *   different thread.
 *
 *   ypar_pulse_async(p, value, usec) returns at once. The leading edge is
 *   written on the calling thread, so the trigger ONSET is never delayed by
 *   thread scheduling. One ysp/rt.h deadline worker per port writes the
 *   trailing 0 at an absolute deadline taken right after the onset write.
 *   The worker is started by ypar_open(), so no trial pays for thread
 *   creation and the rung it obtained is final before the first pulse. It
 *   elevates ITSELF as far as this OS and this process's privileges allow:
 *   SCHED_DEADLINE with the reservation in ypar_desc.sched (default 1 ms of
 *   CPU per 10 ms), else SCHED_FIFO 80 (above the kernel's threaded IRQ
 *   handlers, below migration and the watchdog), else a normal thread with
 *   the 50 us timer slack dropped, on Linux; THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL
 *   on Windows. Asking is not getting: SCHED_DEADLINE needs CAP_SYS_NICE
 *   and is refused as well when the thread's affinity is not the full root
 *   domain (taskset, cpusets, an isolcpus-pinned rig), and the fall back is
 *   silent.
 *
 *   ypar_port.async_policy is the rung the worker got, a yrt_policy.
 *   yrt_policy_name() prints it. Log it: the same jitter histogram means
 *   different things at different rungs.
 *
 *   The worker cannot report a failed trailing-edge write through
 *   ypar_error(), because the message buffer belongs to the calling thread.
 *   It sets ypar_port.async_write_failed instead. The flag is sticky: check
 *   it between trials or at the end of a block, and treat it as "the data
 *   lines may still be asserted, and some trigger offsets are missing". A
 *   YPAR_BACKEND_DIRECT worker that cannot get its own ioperm()/iopl() grant
 *   is NOT one of the cases it covers: that is settled at open time, where
 *   it fails ypar_open() outright.
 *
 *   Every data write on a handle is serialized under one lock this header
 *   owns. It is not ysp/rt.h's worker lock: that one guards the job slot and
 *   is released before the trailing edge runs, which is what lets the
 *   callback take this one. A plain ypar_write_data() or ypar_pulse() issued
 *   while an async pulse is pending CANCELS that pulse's trailing edge: a
 *   write means "hold these lines", and a stale trailing 0 must not undo it.
 *   The cancel is not a race the write can lose, not even against a worker
 *   already inside its final spin window, where yrt_worker_cancel() no
 *   longer bites: both take this header's lock, and the trailing edge writes
 *   only if the pending token it was submitted with is still the current
 *   one. A ypar_pulse_async() issued while one is pending moves the single
 *   trailing edge to the newer off-time, earlier or later. ypar_close()
 *   stops the worker, which runs a pending trailing edge IMMEDIATELY rather
 *   than waiting out the rest of the width, so the lines are never left
 *   asserted.
 *
 *   Timing is best-effort and bounded by OS scheduling. For the tightest
 *   triggers use YPAR_BACKEND_DIRECT on a real-time-tuned kernel with an
 *   isolated CPU. Measure on your rig with a scope or a second recorder,
 *   and record async_policy with the numbers; do not assume.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ysp/rt.h must sit beside this header. It is included by source, so it
 *   adds nothing to the link line; point -I / /I at the parent of the ysp/
 *   directory holding the pair.
 *
 *   Link -pthread on Linux for the async worker; Windows needs no extra
 *   library. ysp/rt.h BUILDING carries the rest of the POSIX link line,
 *   since it is now the header that reads the clock and raises the thread.
 *
 *   YPAR_NO_THREADS drops threading and ypar_pulse_async entirely, and
 *   defines YRT_NO_THREADS for you so ysp/rt.h's worker goes with it. The
 *   two must agree within a translation unit. If you include ysp/rt.h
 *   BEFORE ysp/parallel.h, define YRT_NO_THREADS yourself alongside
 *   YPAR_NO_THREADS: by then ysp/rt.h has already read the macro. Define
 *   both or neither. YRT_NO_THREADS alone is a compile error here rather
 *   than a ypar_pulse_async() with no worker to call.
 *
 *   Define YPAR_API to override the default `extern` linkage. YRT_API is
 *   separate and belongs to ysp/rt.h.

/* ======================================================================= *
 *  ASYNC PULSE
 *
 *  The trailing edge of a non-blocking pulse is one job on one ysp/rt.h
 *  deadline worker per port. The leading edge is written by the caller, in
 *  ypar_pulse_async, so the onset never waits for a thread to wake; the
 *  worker only waits out an absolute deadline and then writes 0. There is
 *  one pending off-deadline per port, so a pulse issued while one is in
 *  flight moves that single trailing edge rather than queueing a second.
 *
 *  ysp/rt.h runs the job with ITS lock released, and cannot cancel a job
 *  that has already entered its final spin window. So this header keeps a
 *  lock of its own over the data register, plus a token: every data write
 *  bumps the token, and the trailing edge writes only while the token it was
 *  submitted with is still the current one. That is what keeps "a plain
 *  write cancels a pending trailing edge" a guarantee instead of a race, and
 *  it is what serializes the two writers on one register.
 *
 *  The lock order is one-way and therefore deadlock-free: a caller takes
 *  this lock and then calls into ysp/rt.h (submit or cancel, which take
 *  ysp/rt.h's own), while the job takes this one with ysp/rt.h's already
 *  released.
