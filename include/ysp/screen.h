/* ysp/screen.h - v0.5.0 - public domain single-header display library
 *
 *   The window, the GL ES 3.0 context, the display mode and the swap path
 *   of a stimulus display, with flip at a time: each frame learns the
 *   predicted onset of the flip it draws for, presents for a target time
 *   on the ysp/rt.h clock, and gets a record of the vblank it was shown on,
 *   the residual, the drops, the composition path and where the frame's
 *   time went. Also: display and mode lists, the mode whose refresh is a
 *   multiple of a video's rate, a photodiode patch, input timestamps on
 *   the ysp/rt.h clock, and several displays.
 *
 *   REQUIRES ysp/rt.h beside it (the clock, the waits, the event ring, the
 *   instrumentation macros), ysp/input.h (the input event, v0.4.0), and
 *   SDL3 (3.2 or later) to link. On Windows it
 *   also needs ANGLE's libEGL.dll and libGLESv2.dll at run time; nothing
 *   ANGLE or Khronos is needed to compile. Copy ysp/screen.h and ysp/rt.h.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. C99 is
 *   the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC
 *   compiles by default.

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.5.0 - open() settles the start of the run (SETTLE; decided
 *          2026-10-09): black frames until an OS time, 6 clean flips on
 *          one path and depth, the spread of the last 20 vblank intervals
 *          and, in a window, 2.5 s; capped at 3 s (4 s in a window). At
 *          the cap AUTO fails open() fullscreen and warns in a window;
 *          desc.settle, settle_flips, settle_min_ns, settle_max_ns and the
 *          YSP_SETTLE variable change it. Every outcome is in the describe
 *          line, a YSCR_EV_SETTLE ring record and yscr_settle_check().
 *          Measured before (docs/screen.md, "Settling at open"): every bad
 *          record, path and depth change of 120 opens came in the first
 *          0.66 s. Fixed: COMPOSITION in a window reported each flip a
 *          second time as an overlay frame, and the path and depth flapped
 *          on frames 0 to 5 (9 to 13 depth changes per open); a statistic
 *          for a completed present now changes no path.
 *   v0.4.4 -The depth comes from the path, never from misses (DEPTH;
 *          decided 2026-10-09): measured at open on DXGI_FLIP (never above
 *          the smallest depth 2 of open's flips showed), the path's on
 *          COMPOSITION (independent flip 1, composed and overlay 2), the
 *          new path's at each path change. A miss is a drop and nothing
 *          more. On DXGI_FLIP a flip that was not held and showed early
 *          lowers it to what it showed, since only that proves it too high.
 *          desc.depth pins it; desc.depth_learn keeps v0.4.3's rule
 *          (opt-in: with steady GPU work near a period it dropped 1 to 6
 *          frames in 600 where the default dropped 3 to 57). Each change
 *          writes a YSCR_EV_DEPTH ring record and the describe line counts
 *          them. Measured on v0.4.3's stress runs: no early flip after
 *          heavy frames (3 per run before); every early flip and depth
 *          change left is in a run's first 6 frames.
 *          AUTO picks COMPOSITION where it opens with independent flip,
 *          else DXGI_FLIP (BACKENDS; decided 2026-10-09 on 10-minute runs:
 *          equal prediction p99, drops and tiers, no early flip); the
 *          describe line and YSCR_EV_MODE's u.i32[5] say what AUTO did.
 *          Fixed: when open() got no OS time (a window covered at open;
 *          COMPOSITION after a session unlock), the guessed grid stayed:
 *          every record tier 3 and the sync guard fired on on-time flips.
 *          The first OS time now replaces the guess.
 *   v0.4.3 - Fixed: held frames shown a vblank early on DXGI_FLIP (THE
 *          GRID; docs/screen.md, "Held frames a vblank early"). While
 *          frames were held, DXGI's refresh count lost about 1 vblank in
 *          25 and 15% of its vblank times were up to half a period off
 *          the vblanks, which D3DKMTGetScanLine showed steady. The grid
 *          moved to those times, so the next hold woke before the real
 *          vblank: 26 to 72 of 1200 held frames were shown a vblank
 *          early in fullscreen, idle, in every version since v0.2.0, and
 *          the lost counts flagged about 145 more EARLY that were on time.
 *          Now a flip's vblank is the grid's nearest to the OS's time;
 *          only times on the grid move it, or 16 in a row that agree on a
 *          new phase; when 48 of 64 times are off it, it follows them as
 *          before. A record whose OS time is off the grid has the grid's
 *          vblank time as onset (GRID_UNSTABLE, tier 2). Measured: 0 early
 *          in 1200 held frames fullscreen; with load, misses and holds,
 *          3 of 3600 (from the depth rule, not the grid).
 *   v0.4.2 - The sync guard (SYNC GUARD): a driver setting that forces
 *          vsync off is detected from the flips. When 32 of the last 64
 *          flips with an OS time came two in one refresh, flipped with no
 *          vblank after their present, or tore, or a block of 64 or more
 *          refreshes saw more presents complete than its refreshes plus
 *          8, the screen is untimed: from that flip
 *          on every record is tier 3 with the new flag YSCR_FLIP_UNSYNCED,
 *          a YSCR_EV_UNSYNCED ring record marks the flip, the describe
 *          line warns, and yscr_sync_check() gives the evidence and a
 *          message that names the AMD, NVIDIA, Intel and Mesa settings.
 *          Fixed (INPUT, "Second key reports"): a device-0 key-up of a
 *          dropped report could take another keyboard's held key, so
 *          key_double_ups missed it and that keyboard's own key-up passed
 *          too; a device-0 key-up now goes first to a press kept with a
 *          keyboard's id that has a dropped report pending, and a key-up
 *          pairs with its own device's press before one with device 0.
 *   v0.4.1 - yscr_event_input() drops SDL 3.4's second key reports (INPUT,
 *          "Second key reports"): a key-down of the same key within 50 ms
 *          of the last one kept, from the same keyboard or with either
 *          device 0, and that report's key-up. It was ysp/response.h's
 *          rule R3, which only its collector got. Counted in
 *          yscr_input_stats (key_doubles, key_double_ups) and logged as a
 *          YSCR_EV_KEY_DOUBLE ring record each; desc.key_dedup_ns sets
 *          the window or turns the filter off; yscr_key_filter() applies
 *          it to events from elsewhere.
 *   v0.4.0 - The input bridge (INPUT, "The input bridge"): any thread hands
 *          ysp/input.h events to yscr_push_input(); each one is stored
 *          and announced by an SDL event (a doorbell) in SDL's queue, so
 *          yscr_poll() returns keyboard, mouse, raw mice, response boxes
 *          and eye trackers in one stream, and yscr_event_input() turns
 *          any input event of that stream (a doorbell or SDL's own) into a
 *          yin_event. Raw mice go over the bridge; yscr_poll_mouse()
 *          is deprecated and reads them back for one more version.
 *          Breaking: ysp/screen.h requires ysp/input.h beside it (types and
 *          inline adapters only); yscr_mouse_event is ysp/input.h's
 *          yin_mouse_report. Defaults unchanged: no producer, no doorbell.
 *   v0.3.5 - Raw mice (INPUT, "Raw mice"): desc.raw_mice reads every
 *          mouse's Raw Input on a thread of its own, per device and
 *          stamped when read, and yscr_poll_mouse() hands the reports
 *          out (buttons, wheel, unaccelerated deltas). A guard registers
 *          again after SDL's relative mode took the mice, and logs it.
 *          Off by default: mice come through SDL as before.
 *   v0.3.4 - The input devices in the ring (INPUT, "Devices"): a
 *          YSCR_EV_DEVICE record for each keyboard, mouse, touch device
 *          and (with desc.gamepads) gamepad SDL lists at open, and for each
 *          one added or removed later (seen in yscr_poll()), and for a
 *          pen or touch device the first time it is used: kind, id and
 *          name, so a data file's device column maps to a device.
 *   v0.3.3 - Input for ysp/response.h (INPUT): desc.gamepads starts SDL's
 *          gamepad subsystem and opens each gamepad, so its events come
 *          through yscr_poll() (off by default, as before);
 *          caps.raw_keyboard says whether keys come on SDL's raw path. The
 *          Text input is observed, not only commanded: flip_at() reads
 *          SDL_TextInputActive(), so text input that another library
 *          started (Dear ImGui's SDL3 backend) gets the ring record (with
 *          u.u32[5] 1, external) and the flip flag too. The
 *          INPUT text on SDL 3.4's double key report is narrowed to what
 *          was measured: it comes from keys whose window message has no
 *          scan code (virtual-key injection), not from every key. Reports
 *          of one abort press within 50 ms (was 30) are one press: the
 *          second report came up to 34.2 ms later, and a tool that injects
 *          by virtual key could otherwise turn two presses into a panic.
 *   v0.3.2 - yscr_text_input() (INPUT, "Text input"): starts or stops SDL
 *          text input on a screen's window and sets the IME area, for a
 *          text box. Each change writes a YSCR_EV_TEXT_INPUT ring record,
 *          and every flip planned while it is on carries
 *          YSCR_FLIP_TEXT_INPUT, so analysis sees when keys were off the
 *          raw timed path. Off at open, as before.
 *   v0.3.1 - Aborts (ABORT): Shift+Esc, a close request, Alt+F4, SDL's
 *          quit event and yscr_request_abort() each make one begin()
 *          return YSCR_QUIT with f.abort, f.abort_presses and f.abort_ns,
 *          and a YSCR_EV_ABORT ring record; the header sees them through
 *          an SDL event watch, also when the caller reads the events first.
 *          The panic watchdog (PANIC, desc.panic, off by default): Shift+Esc
 *          3 times in 2 s while the frame loop reports no abort puts back
 *          the gamma ramps and ends the process (exit code 99); Windows
 *          puts back a switched mode as it ends. The window icon
 *          (WINDOW ICON): Escher's impossible cube at 16, 32 and 48
 *          pixels; desc.icon_rgba, desc.icon_sdl.
 *          desc.d3d11_video (NATIVE HANDLES): a D3D11 device with video
 *          support and multithread protection; yscr_native_info gains
 *          video and mt_protected. yscr_begin_group() reports an abort on
 *          every member and begins none. close(), exit and the watchdog
 *          claim a gamma entry atomically, so one of them puts it back.
 *          Breaking: Esc alone no longer
 *          ends the loop; desc.no_esc_quit is gone (desc.abort_keys);
 *          yscr_frame gains abort, abort_presses and abort_ns;
 *          yscr_presenter_open gains d3d11_video (the presenter version
 *          stays 2).
 *   v0.3.0 - Flip hooks for triggers. Codes (CODES): exact device values in
 *          the frame, per flip or held, as rectangles or rows, drawn last,
 *          with presets for VPixx Pixel Mode and pixel sync, a self test at
 *          open, an optional read-back, record.code_risk and a CODE ring
 *          record. Triggers (TRIGGERS): callbacks on a deadline worker at
 *          a flip's planned vblank, armed when the present returns, moved
 *          when the header learns the flip will be late, a TRIGGER ring
 *          record, and an optional GPU fence check; the worker runs on the
 *          E-cores of a hybrid CPU on Windows and arms itself for the next
 *          vblank after a flip trigger. After flip (AFTER
 *          FLIP): yscr_on_flip(); yscr_frame.done lists every
 *          record completed since the last begin(). yscr_native()
 *          (NATIVE HANDLES). Fixed: after a flip shown early when the
 *          depth fell, begin() planned the next frame for the same vblank
 *          (DEPTH). Before present (GL STATE):
 *          yscr_on_present(), yscr_gl_epoch(), yscr_gl_generation().
 *          OS GAMMA: a fullscreen screen on Windows takes the OS gamma ramp
 *          to identity and gives it back at close and at exit. Breaking:
 *          yscr_record gains code_risk; yscr_frame gains done, n_done
 *          and done_lost; yscr_present_req, the presenter
 *          and its open struct gain fields (YSCR_PRESENTER_VERSION 2).
 *   v0.2.0 - The Windows 11 composition swapchain (YSCR_BACKEND_COMPOSITION)
 *          with present at a target time. Tiers: each flip record carries
 *          yscr_tier, caps.worst_tier and the describe line report the
 *          worst since open, and desc.min_tier flags flips below it. New
 *          flags SKIPPED, CANCELED, ONSET_PLANNED and BELOW_TIER. Breaking:
 *          yscr_record.path and yscr_vblank.path are uint8_t and a tier
 *          byte follows each; the ring's mode word is path in bits 0..2,
 *          flags in bits 3..12 and the tier in bits 13..15 (read it with
 *          YSCR_EV_PATH_OF, _FLAGS_OF and _TIER_OF). On Windows the raw
 *          keyboard path is on (SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_RAW_KEYBOARD, at default
 *          priority) and SDL text input is stopped. AUTO stays DXGI_FLIP.
 *          The depth on a backend that holds frames to their target is
 *          raised by misses and lowered only on slack evidence, per path,
 *          never by a try (DEPTH); begin() never predicts a vblank a flip
 *          in flight already has. Fixed: on DXGI_FLIP a flip_at() call
 *          within the margin before a vblank presented at once, and the
 *          frame showed a vblank before the one planned (EARLY set); it now
 *          waits for that vblank.
 *   v0.1.0 - first release: the DXGI flip swap path (Windows 10 and 11)
 *          through ANGLE, the simulated display, the presenter interface,
 *          prediction, the snap, the per-flip record, phases, the patch,
 *          groups, input restamping, mode lists and the parameter table.
 *          The other swap paths are stubs that refuse to open.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.4.4 (the depth from the path, AUTO = COMPOSITION;
 *   docs/screen.md, "Depth from the path" and "AUTO, decided"). Two swap paths run, DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION, on one
 *   machine: a Windows 11 25H2 laptop whose Intel Iris Xe drives a 1920 x
 *   1200 panel at 60.0008 Hz (60 Hz is its only rate), with the ANGLE that
 *   ships in Docker Desktop's Electron front end (2.1.23876, git
 *   fffbc739779a; not a pinned build) and SDL3 3.4.0. Built with MSVC 19.4
 *   under /W4 /WX as C11 and C++17 and with MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 under
 *   -Werror, and run from the MSVC build. No photodiode has been attached:
 *   tests/loopback/screen_loopback.c is built and has never run, so the
 *   delay from a reported vblank to light is UNMEASURED, and
 *   desc.onset_offset_ns stays 0 until it is.
 *   DXGI_FLIP (v0.1.0, unchanged; docs/screen.md has the tables):
 *   fullscreen on the overlay path, the onset was within 2.3 us of the
 *   prediction at p99 over 7200 frames, no frame dropped or late; in a
 *   plain window (composed) for 10 minutes, 5.7 us p99, no drop. In v0.2
 *   runs a window kept on top moved between the overlay and the composed
 *   path every 5 to 11 s; per minute that gave 27 to 67 drops, 9 to 15
 *   flips a vblank early (each flagged EARLY) and 13 to 96 flips with no
 *   statistic, and twice the waitable object freed no slot for 333 ms
 *   (begin() returned YSCR_ERR_TIMEOUT). The cause was not found.
 *   COMPOSITION (new; Windows 11, x64): in a window kept on top every flip
 *   but 2 to 9 per run was an independent flip, tier 1 (the rest were
 *   overlay frames, tier 3). For 10 minutes (36000 frames): 2.3 us
 *   p99 and 8.1 us max from the prediction, 12 drops, no flip without a
 *   statistic. Six 1-minute runs that alternated with DXGI_FLIP: 0 to 24
 *   drops for COMPOSITION against 27 to 67, 0 to 15 flips without a
 *   statistic against 13 to 96, no early flip against 9 to 15, 2.1 to 2.5
 *   us p99 against 4.5 to 5.4 us (the two DXGI_FLIP runs without a
 *   timeout). These window runs, and the 10-minute run, came before the
 *   depth rule that lowers only on evidence and before the fix for a flip
 *   called inside the margin before a vblank, which showed one vblank
 *   early on DXGI_FLIP. That fault may explain some of DXGI_FLIP's early
 *   flips above. None of them was run again.
 *   Fullscreen on AC, 1 minute each on the quiet machine: v0.2
 *   DXGI_FLIP 2.33 us p99, COMPOSITION 2.36 us, a v0.1 control 2.32 us, no
 *   drop. (While another program ran load threads on the machine, both
 *   backends gave 75 to 110 us p99 and 21 to 29 drops in fullscreen.) From
 *   the present call's return to the reported onset (scanout start, not
 *   light): 15.96 ms p50 on DXGI_FLIP overlay, 15.63 ms on COMPOSITION
 *   independent flip, every frame on the next vblank; a composed DXGI_FLIP
 *   frame took a vblank more (32.6 ms). Holds 0 to 4 vblanks ahead: 1800
 *   of 1800 fullscreen and 2979 of 2998 in a window on the vblank asked for,
 *   19 late, 0 early. Overruns of 17 and 20 ms: 84 of 84 flagged
 *   LATE_TARGET with the draw phase charged, no miss without a flag. The
 *   header's CPU time per frame in the 10-minute window run: begin() 21.8
 *   us mean (SDL_PumpEvents() 11.0 us, statistics 7.9 us), flip_at() 1.8
 *   us; that misses the 20 us bar, on the OS calls. The present call costs
 *   more than on DXGI_FLIP: 530 to 1230 us mean against 380 to 730 us
 *   in the alternating runs. No C runtime heap call per frame in a debug
 *   build (2 once per run, made by the runtime for an OS component's C++
 *   exception on the frame thread). With one frame in flight, the next
 *   frame waits for the last one's statistic, and the loop used about 99%
 *   of vblanks
 *   in a window (16.85 ms mean frame time).
 *   AUTO (v0.4.4) picks COMPOSITION where it opens with independent
 *   flip. 10 minutes each, idle, AC: fullscreen 1.92 us p99 against
 *   DXGI_FLIP's 1.88, in a window 1.82 against 1.78; 0 and 1 drops on
 *   both; no early flip against 4 (DXGI_FLIP's window, at the start).
 *   Against it: its present call costs about twice as much (463 against
 *   222 us mean), it needs Windows 11 x64, its composed onset is tier 3
 *   where DXGI_FLIP's is tier 2, and a covered window gets no statistic.
 *   What the onset is (measured against the scanout's own vblank entry,
 *   polled with D3DKMTGetScanLine): an independent flip's DisplayedTime
 *   was 13 us after it at p50 and 77 us at p99, came 0.3 ms later, and
 *   moved with a late frame: an observation, tier 1. A composed frame's
 *   time from DComp's target statistics also sat on the vblank (26 us p50)
 *   and moved with a late frame, but came about 15 ms BEFORE that vblank:
 *   it is DWM's plan, so it carries YSCR_FLIP_ONSET_PLANNED and tier 3.
 *   A second window loading the GPU did not make DWM miss a frame (its own
 *   counters stayed 0), so whether a DWM miss shows in the record is
 *   UNMEASURED: on COMPOSITION, a composed onset is DWM's claim. Present
 *   targets and displayed times are QPC time in 100 ns units here (QPC
 *   runs at 10 MHz); interrupt time is 20.03 ms away and was wrong. On a
 *   machine whose QPC runs at another rate this is unverified.
 *   Tiers, from these runs: DXGI_FLIP overlay and COMPOSITION independent
 *   flip are tier 1; DXGI_FLIP composed is tier 2 (DWM's vblank, measured
 *   against nothing else); a flip whose OS time is off the grid (up to
 *   half a period; the scanout's vblanks stayed on it) is tier 2, with the
 *   grid's vblank time as onset; COMPOSITION composed or
 *   overlay frames and every ESTIMATED flip are tier 3.
 *   Input: SDL's tick clock correlates to the ysp_rt clock within 0.1 us.
 *   Keys sent with SendInput(): on the raw path, stamped 0.18 to 0.67 ms
 *   after the call (mean 0.39 ms, 199 keys); through the message loop,
 *   from 6.2 ms before to 12.1 ms after it.
 *   The core (prediction, snap, drops, depth, estimated, skipped and
 *   canceled records, tiers, the ring record, phases, groups, errors, the
 *   mode picker, preemption, codes, triggers and their moves, the
 *   after-flip and present callbacks, aborts, the panic rule, the icon
 *   data) is checked without SDL or a display by
 *   tests/adapt/screen_test.c against a scripted swap path on a
 *   virtual clock, so the host's load cannot change a result, on MSVC,
 *   MinGW gcc 16.1, gcc 11.4 (WSL2; also as C99 at -O3, as C++17, and
 *   under ASan and UBSan, and 8 of 8 runs with a busy loop on its CPU) and
 *   clang (emcc, run in node); 43 deliberate mutations of the header
 *   each make it fail (v0.3.1's 12 and v0.3.2's 2 checked with MinGW
 *   only), and the 9 of v0.4.3 (eg- in tests/mutate/screen.toml). v0.3.2's text input: its records and flag on the scripted path
 *   (MSVC, MinGW); its SDL calls by hand in examples/layout/gfx_layout.c.
 *   CODES and TRIGGERS (v0.3.0, measured on battery, Balanced plan; the
 *   tables are in docs/screen.md): the open-time self test passed on
 *   DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION, and 1800 code read-backs in fullscreen
 *   differed 0 times. Drawing a 1-pixel and an 8-pixel code cost 3.8 us
 *   mean on the GPU context with one ClearView per pixel, 5.3 us with
 *   UpdateSubresource, so rows of up to 8 pixels use ClearView. This
 *   laptop runs auto color management (color=wcg in the describe line),
 *   so every code here is at risk (CODE_RISK_ADVANCED_COLOR); no device
 *   has read one. A trigger fired p50 1.0 to 2.1 us, p99 59 to 300 us and
 *   at most 0.6 to 7.9 ms after its deadline (TIME_CRITICAL worker; the
 *   larger numbers in a window), on the P-cores where ysp/rt.h puts the
 *   worker. The cause, measured: the display's vblank DPC, 50 to 400 us
 *   from about 75 us before the vblank, ran on the P-core the worker spun
 *   on; the trigger lock and the spin window were not the cause. The
 *   worker now runs on the E-cores of a hybrid CPU: this machine's way
 *   to keep it off the vblank DPC's CPU, not a rule (TRIGGERS). On AC, 1
 *   minute each: fullscreen p99 1.6 to 2.6 us on both backends (31 and 29
 *   us before); in a window 1.0 to 3.2 us (32 to 169 us before). The
 *   tail is the OS's and stays: 1 to 15 triggers a minute fired over 200
 *   us late (1 to 22 before), the largest 0.35 to 43 ms (0.37 to 12.6 ms
 *   before), so the 200 us bar for the largest is missed. Without a
 *   display, examples/rt/jitter.c on the same cores woke up to 2.6 and
 *   32.6 ms late with the same 1.2 ms spin window (on the P-cores, 3.0
 *   ms and 20 us). With 3 frames of 25 ms GPU work every
 *   300 frames: without the GPU check 72 of 72 triggers fired a frame
 *   early; with desc.trigger_fence 140 of 142 moved in time and 0 moved
 *   in error, and no move in 10800 idle frames. The fence stays off by
 *   default until it runs on more than one GPU. Arming a trigger cost the
 *   frame thread about 8 us on battery and 3.8 us on AC in flip_at(), most
 *   of it the worker's wake-up; the worker now arms itself for the next
 *   vblank after each flip trigger, so a trigger every frame arms with no
 *   wake-up: 0.6 to 0.9 us mean on AC, flip_at() 1.7 to 2.6 us in all.
 *   The OS gamma ramp: this laptop's is the identity, so
 *   open() set nothing; setting the same ramp again and reading it back
 *   was exact; one GetDeviceGammaRamp costs 0.8 ms, so it is read at open
 *   only. Whether the ramp acts on independent-flip and overlay frames,
 *   and under Night Light, was not measured.
 *   ABORT, PANIC, ICON and d3d11_video (v0.3.1, AC, keys sent with
 *   SendInput; docs/screen.md has the tables): Shift+Esc gave one
 *   abort per press, stamped 0.12 to 0.70 ms after the call, also when the
 *   loop read its events before begin(); Esc alone gave none; a held
 *   Shift+Esc gave one. SDL 3.4 reports a key injected by virtual-key code
 *   twice on the raw path (INPUT); the header counts one. A hung program ended 28 to 85 ms after
 *   the third press, after its panic_fn ran and a gamma entry was put
 *   back; after a 7 s hang, with Windows' ghost window in front, too; a
 *   held Shift+Esc did not panic; a responsive loop got 5 aborts for 5
 *   presses and no panic. Fullscreen at 1680 x 1050 on the 1920 x 1200
 *   desktop, hung: the desktop mode was back 1.2 s after press 3, as the
 *   process ended. With the watchdog's hook armed, keys on the raw path
 *   were stamped no later (p50 0.30 to
 *   0.31 ms against 0.35 to 0.46 ms, 3 interleaved runs of 199 keys). The
 *   header's CPU time per frame, begin() without its wait, 3 interleaved
 *   rounds of 1800 frames in a window on top: 22.5 to 25.2 us mean with
 *   d3d11_video off, 19.6 to 26.3 us with it on, 20.0 to 29.5 us for the
 *   v0.3.0 header; flip_at() 1.5 to 2.2 us in all. No difference shows
 *   beyond the spread between rounds. Alt+F4 was not sent (if the focus
 *   moved, it would close another program); the core test checks it
 *   through the feed. The icons reach the window at 16 and 32 pixels as
 *   drawn (read back, 96 dpi).
 *   tests/compile/screen_com.cpp checks every COM slot and struct the
 *   header declares against the Windows SDK (MSVC; MinGW for DComp only).
 *   NOT done: any rate but 60 Hz, any other GPU, Windows 10 (COMPOSITION
 *   needs 11), ARM64 (COMPOSITION refuses it: the hidden-pointer returns
 *   are checked only on x64), two physical displays, variable refresh
 *   (refused), macOS, X11 and Wayland swap paths (stubs). Linux runs the
 *   core and the simulated display only.
 *   Outside this STATUS block and docs/screen.md, a number in this
 *   header is a measurement only where the text says "measured".
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_SCREEN_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header to create the
 *   implementation. Every other file just includes the header normally.
 *   ysp/rt.h's implementation comes with it, once, as with the other ysp
 *   headers. Link SDL3.
 *
 *   A trial of ysp/timeline.h on the display (examples/screen/hello.c runs
 *   it):
 *
 *       #define YSP_SCREEN_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       #include "ysp/screen.h"
 *
 *       static yscr_screen scr;                 // zeroed
 *       if (!yscr_open(&scr, &(yscr_desc){ .ring = &ring }))
 *           die(yscr_error(&scr));              // fullscreen, primary display
 *       yscr_frame f;
 *       while (yscr_begin(&scr, &f) == YSCR_OK) {   // Shift+Esc ends it
 *           if (f.index == 0) ytl_anchor(&tl, TRIAL, f.onset, 0);
 *           int n = ytl_evaluate(&tl, &(ytl_frame){ f.onset, f.period, f.index },
 *                                  fired, 8);
 *           draw(ytl_values(&tl));
 *           yscr_flip(&scr);                    // at f.onset
 *       }
 *       yscr_close(&scr);
 *
 *   The timeline evaluates at f.onset, the predicted onset of the flip the
 *   frame draws for, so what a frame shows is a function of when it
 *   appears. The measured record of each flip arrives one frame later, in
 *   f.last and in the ring. Compound literals and designated initializers
 *   are C99; in C++17 zero a yscr_desc and set its fields.
 *
 *   Psychtoolbox and PsychoPy, for comparison:
 *
 *       vbl = Screen('Flip', win);                % PTB
 *       for i = 1:n
 *           Screen('FillRect', win, contrast(i) * 255, rect);
 *           [vbl, onset, ~, missed] = Screen('Flip', win, vbl + 0.5 * ifi);
 *       end
 *
 *       for frame in range(n):                    # PsychoPy
 *           grating.contrast = contrast[frame]
 *           grating.draw()
 *           win.flip()
 *
 *   Both draw frame i for "the next flip" and leave the caller to work out
 *   when that is. PTB's Flip blocks until the vblank and returns its time;
 *   yscr_wait_flip() does the same here, at the cost of one frame of
 *   pipelining.
 *
 *   Present at a later time, and mark the phases of a frame:
 *
 *       yscr_begin(&scr, &f);
 *       ytl_evaluate(...);
 *       yscr_mark(&scr, YSCR_PHASE_EVALUATE);
 *       upload_textures();
 *       yscr_mark(&scr, YSCR_PHASE_UPLOAD);
 *       draw(...);
 *       yscr_flip_at(&scr, f.onset + 3 * f.period, NULL);   // 3 frames later
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TIME
 *     Every time is an int64_t count of nanoseconds on the ysp/rt.h clock
 *     (yrt_now_ns()), the unit ysp/timeline.h takes. A backend that
 *     stamps on another clock converts at the boundary: DXGI's vblank times
 *     are QueryPerformanceCounter values, the counter yrt_now_ns() reads,
 *     and yrt_ticks_to_ns() converts them with no correlation.
 *
 *   THE GRID
 *     A fixed-refresh display flips on a grid of vblanks. The header keeps
 *     the newest vblank the OS reported (time and count) and the period:
 *     the mode's rational period at first, then the period fitted from the
 *     OS's vblank times over at least 64 vblanks. The describe line shows
 *     the fitted refresh and its difference from the mode's (this laptop's
 *     panel: 60.0008 Hz). A flip's vblank is the grid's nearest to the
 *     OS's time, not the OS's count: on this laptop's DXGI_FLIP, while
 *     frames were held, the count lost about 1 vblank in 25, and 15% of
 *     the times were up to half a period off the vblanks, which the
 *     scanout (D3DKMTGetScanLine) showed steady on the grid; each frame
 *     flipped on the vblank nearest its time. An OS time more than 1% of a
 *     period off the grid sets YSCR_FLIP_GRID_UNSTABLE on its record, the
 *     record's onset is then the grid's vblank time, and the grid does not
 *     move to it: a grid moved there woke the next hold before the real
 *     vblank, and that frame was shown a vblank early (v0.4.2 and before).
 *     The grid moves to a new phase when 16 off-grid times in a row agree
 *     on it, as a changed display timing gives (DXGI's off-grid times
 *     agreed on at most 5 in a row). When 48 of the last 64 times are off
 *     the grid, the vblanks themselves move, or no grid fits: then the
 *     grid follows each time and takes the OS's count, as before v0.4.3,
 *     until 16 of 64 or fewer are off it (DXGI's held frames: at most 34
 *     of 64).
 *
 *   DEPTH
 *     The depth is the number of vblanks from a present call to the flip
 *     that shows it: 1 on an overlay or independent-flip path, 2 when the
 *     compositor copies the frame (measured, docs/screen.md). It comes
 *     from the path, never from misses (decided 2026-10-09: a depth that
 *     rises after misses adds a vblank of latency in the middle of a
 *     task):
 *       - open(), DXGI_FLIP: measured. Black frames until three flips in
 *         a row agree, at least 6 and at most 40, because a window that
 *         has just gone fullscreen is composed for a few frames.
 *       - open(), COMPOSITION: the path's. A present there waits for its
 *         target, so an on-time flip shows only that the depth was enough.
 *       - a path change (YSCR_EV_PATH): the new path's, at once. That is
 *         the depth open() measured on that path, else 1 for independent
 *         flip and a DXGI overlay, 2 for composed and for COMPOSITION's
 *         overlay frames (they come with the compositor's statistics and
 *         showed on the vblank after next). An unknown path keeps it.
 *       - a miss: none. It is a drop, flagged and counted; its tier is as
 *         before.
 *     desc.depth = N (1 to 8) pins it: no measurement, no path following.
 *     On a path that needs more, every flip shows a vblank late (each
 *     record dropped 1, and f.onset a period early); on a path that needs
 *     less, every frame waits the extra vblanks and shows on time (on
 *     DXGI_FLIP the hold wakes at the path's depth, not the pin). A loop
 *     whose GPU work per frame is close to a period can pin 2.
 *     desc.depth_learn (opt-in, not with a pin) is v0.4.3's rule: on
 *     DXGI_FLIP three flips in a row at a new depth change it, and one
 *     flip after a path change; on COMPOSITION three misses in a row
 *     raise it, and it falls only on evidence: per path, the slack of each
 *     flip (the planned vblank's time minus the return of the present
 *     call), on time and missed, must show on 4 flips in a row that one
 *     depth less would have been on time 8 times as often as a miss with
 *     that slack or more; a miss within 4 flips of a lowering clears that
 *     path's on-time counts. Measured (docs/screen.md, "Depth from the
 *     path"): with steady GPU work near a period it dropped 1 to 6 frames
 *     in 600 where the default dropped 3 to 57; after each short run of
 *     misses it moved the depth twice, and the frames after showed early
 *     (DXGI_FLIP) or a vblank apart (COMPOSITION).
 *     Every change writes a YSCR_EV_DEPTH ring record (old, new, reason,
 *     path, frame), and the describe line reads depth=2(path,3 changes).
 *     When the depth falls (composed to overlay), a flip planned at the
 *     old depth can show a vblank early (EARLY). The next frame is planned
 *     a vblank after the early one's plan, never on it, so the early frame
 *     stays on the screen two vblanks; f.onset and f.vblank always rise
 *     from one frame to the next. When the depth rises, a flip planned at
 *     the old depth is shown late (a drop), and the next frame's f.vblank
 *     is 2 on: begin() runs before that drop's record completes.
 *     When open() gets no OS time (a window covered at open, or
 *     COMPOSITION's first statistics late), the grid is a guess and onsets
 *     are tier 3; the first OS time replaces the guess.
 *
 *   SETTLE
 *     The start of a run is not settled when open's depth is measured:
 *     a window moves from the composed path to an overlay plane after
 *     0.5 to 0.7 s (1.7 to 1.9 s under decode load), a window covered at
 *     open gets off-grid times for seconds, and the first flips can be
 *     early, late or without a statistic (docs/screen.md, "Settling at
 *     open"). So open() presents black frames after the depth until all
 *     of these hold at once, like Psychtoolbox's sync tests:
 *       - an OS vblank time (no guessed grid);
 *       - desc.settle_flips (default 6) flips in a row, each with an OS
 *         statistic, on the grid, not early, not late, tier 1 (2 in a
 *         window), on one path and one depth;
 *       - the last 20 vblank intervals: SD at most 50 us and mean within
 *         10 us of the mode's period (120 opens in front: at most 13.5
 *         and 6.7 us; settled, about 1 us);
 *       - the minimum time from the open() call: 2.5 s in a window, none
 *         fullscreen (desc.settle_min_ns; < 0 removes it).
 *     The cap (desc.settle_max_ns) is 3 s fullscreen and 4 s in a window,
 *     from the open() call. At the cap, desc.settle decides: STRICT makes
 *     open() fail with an error that names the condition, WARN opens and
 *     reports it, AUTO (the default) is STRICT fullscreen and WARN in a
 *     window, OFF skips settling. The environment variable YSP_SETTLE
 *     (off, warn or strict) overrides desc.settle, so a developer can turn
 *     it off without a rebuild; any other value fails open(). The SIM
 *     backend and a presenter without OS vblank times skip it. An abort
 *     during settling ends it; the first begin() reports the abort.
 *     Every outcome is recorded, overrides and skips too: the describe
 *     line says settle=0.66s(24 flips), settle=FAILED(grid,flip41,2/6-
 *     clean,warn), settle=SKIPPED(env YSP_SETTLE=off) or ABORTED; a
 *     failure adds WARNING=not-settled; the ring gets one YSCR_EV_SETTLE
 *     record; yscr_settle_check() gives the numbers and a message.
 *     Settle frames are not records: they reach neither f.done nor the
 *     ring's flip records, and the first frame after open() is frame 0.
 *     A statistic for a present that already completed (COMPOSITION in a
 *     window repeated each flip as an overlay frame) changes no path.
 *
 *   PREDICTION
 *     yscr_begin() predicts the first vblank a present made now can
 *     reach: the vblank at or before now plus a margin (an eighth of a
 *     period, at most 1 ms), plus the depth, and never one at or before
 *     the last flip. f.onset is that vblank's time plus desc.onset_offset_ns.
 *
 *   FLIP AT A TIME
 *     yscr_flip_at(t) snaps t to a vblank with ysp/timeline.h's rule: the
 *     first vblank at or after t - lead x period (lead x period truncated to
 *     whole ns). The default lead is 0.5, the nearest vblank, because a
 *     predicted onset carries noise: with "at or after", a t one
 *     microsecond past a vblank goes a whole frame late. A flip and a
 *     timeline event at the same time land on the same frame.
 *     YSCR_LEAD_NONE is never early: the first vblank at or after t.
 *     When the snapped vblank is before the first one the present can
 *     still make, the flip goes to that one and its record has
 *     YSCR_FLIP_LATE_TARGET: the caller was late. When it is later, the
 *     header sleeps on the ysp_rt clock until just after vblank
 *     (planned - depth), and presents then; DXGI shows a frame at the first
 *     vblank it can, so this is what puts it on the planned one. The same
 *     wait applies when the call comes within the margin before a vblank,
 *     which the plan already put the flip after. (DXGI's
 *     own SyncInterval was measured as the other way to hold a frame and
 *     put 795 of 1800 held frames early; see docs/screen.md.)
 *
 *   THE RECORD (yscr_record)
 *     index     the frame number
 *     target    t as given to flip_at
 *     planned   the vblank time the flip was planned for, + offset
 *     onset     the time of the vblank it was shown on, + offset: the OS's
 *               vblank timestamp on DXGI, or the grid's vblank nearest
 *               it when it is off the grid (GRID_UNSTABLE), not a
 *               photon. The photodiode
 *               test (tests/loopback/) measures the difference, which goes
 *               in desc.onset_offset_ns.
 *     residual  onset - target
 *     dropped   vblanks between planned and shown: the system's lateness,
 *               not the caller's (that is LATE_TARGET)
 *     path      YSCR_PATH_COMPOSED, _OVERLAY or _INDEPENDENT on Windows
 *     tier      how far the onset can be trusted (TIERS)
 *     flags     PENDING (not shown yet), ESTIMATED (no OS time for this
 *               present; onset is the planned vblank), LATE_TARGET,
 *               OCCLUDED (no statistic came: the window was covered),
 *               GRID_UNSTABLE (the OS's time was off the vblank grid;
 *               onset is the grid's vblank nearest it), EARLY (shown
 *               before the planned vblank), SKIPPED and CANCELED (never
 *               shown: a later present took the vblank; onset 0, residual
 *               0), ONSET_PLANNED (the onset is the vblank the system
 *               planned the frame for, not one it observed), BELOW_TIER
 *               (tier worse than desc.min_tier)
 *     phase_ns  where the frame's time went, below
 *     A record completes when the OS reports its flip, normally in the next
 *     begin(). DXGI reports only the newest flip, so the header reads the
 *     statistics again before a present and once per vblank while it holds
 *     a frame; a flip that is never reported still gets a record, flagged
 *     ESTIMATED. yscr_wait_flip() waits for all of them.
 *     f.last is the newest completed record. f.done and f.n_done list
 *     every record completed since the begin() before, in completion
 *     order (the ring's), whether it completed in begin(), in flip_at()
 *     while a frame was held, or in wait_flip(); the last one is f.last.
 *     The list is valid until the next begin(), and holds at most
 *     YSCR_MAX_DONE (16; f.done_lost counts any that did not fit). A
 *     record completed in close() reaches the ring and on_flip only.
 *
 *   PHASES
 *     phase_ns[YSCR_PHASE_EVALUATE, _SCRIPT, _DRAW, _UPLOAD] is the time
 *     charged by yscr_mark(); the time not marked before flip_at() goes
 *     to _DRAW. _SWAP is begin()'s wait for a slot plus the present call,
 *     not flip_at()'s planned wait for a later vblank. _GPU is
 *     YSCR_PHASE_UNKNOWN in v0.1: a GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query per frame
 *     was built and measured, and it tracked the GPU work but cost about
 *     250 us of CPU per frame through ANGLE, so it was taken out
 *     (docs/screen.md). A frame that was late shows which phase took
 *     the time, with no tool attached.
 *
 *   THE RING
 *     With desc.ring set, each completed record is one yrt_event:
 *       source  YRT_SRC_SCREEN        kind  YSCR_EV_FLIP
 *       t_ns    onset                   aux   desc.display_index
 *       u.i64[0]  target
 *       u.u16[4]  dropped, at most 65535
 *       u.u16[5]  path in bits 0..2, flags in bits 3..12, tier in bits
 *                 13..15: YSCR_EV_PATH_OF(), _FLAGS_OF(), _TIER_OF()
 *       u.u32[3..8]  phase_ns[0..5]
 *       u.u32[9]  the frame index, low 32 bits (ytl_event.frame)
 *     Residual is t_ns - u.i64[0]. A flip never shown carries its planned
 *     vblank in t_ns, because the ring reads 0 as "now". Also
 *     YSCR_EV_PATH when the path
 *     changes (u.u16[0] old, u.u16[1] new) and YSCR_EV_MODE at open
 *     (u.i32[0..5] w, h, refresh_num, refresh_den, backend, and how AUTO
 *     chose it: YSCR_AUTO_*). Records arrive in completion order, which is
 *     not always frame order. YSCR_EV_DEPTH at open and at each change of
 *     depth (DEPTH). YSCR_EV_TEXT_INPUT, YSCR_EV_DEVICE, YSCR_EV_RAW_MICE
 *     and YSCR_EV_INPUT_LOST: INPUT. YSCR_EV_UNSYNCED: SYNC GUARD.
 *
 *   ONE FRAME IN FLIGHT
 *     begin() waits until the swap path takes a frame, so the frame drawn
 *     is never more than one present behind the screen. DXGI: a frame
 *     latency waitable object with SetMaximumFrameLatency(1) and 2 buffers.
 *     COMPOSITION: the previous present has a statistic that settles it
 *     (shown, skipped or canceled) and one of 3 buffers is free. Present at
 *     a time could queue several future frames; that is not done, so each
 *     frame is drawn against a fresh prediction and fresh input.
 *
 *   GL STATE (what a renderer on this header, such as ysp/gfx.h, relies on)
 *     begin() makes the context current on the calling thread with the back
 *     buffer as framebuffer 0. caps.mode.w and caps.mode.h are the back
 *     buffer's size in pixels, in a window too. On DXGI_FLIP and
 *     COMPOSITION, framebuffer 0 is ANGLE's pbuffer on a D3D11 texture, and
 *     its row 0 is the top row of the screen, not the bottom as in GL
 *     (measured, docs/gfx.md); a renderer that writes rows in screen
 *     order must flip them. flip_at() on DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION changes
 *     no GL state (the patch is a ClearView after ANGLE's flush); on a
 *     presenter without draws_patch, the GL patch puts back what it changes
 *     (PHOTODIODE PATCH). Nothing else here touches GL state, so a renderer
 *     sets what it needs once per frame, except the present callback:
 *     yscr_on_present(fn) calls fn inside flip_at(), after your drawing
 *     and before the header's flush and present, with the context current
 *     and framebuffer 0 bound. fn may draw with GL and change any state;
 *     the header puts nothing back for it. Two counters tell a renderer
 *     that caches GL state what happened behind its back:
 *       yscr_gl_epoch()       changes after every present callback: GL
 *                               state may differ from your cache. Drop the
 *                               cache and set state again.
 *       yscr_gl_generation()  changes when the context is new: every GL
 *                               object made before is gone (0 while
 *                               closed). Today only open() makes a context,
 *                               and a lost device ends the screen with
 *                               YSCR_ERR_LOST, so it is constant from
 *                               open to close.
 *     YSCR_HAS_GL_EPOCH is defined when both exist.
 *
 *   TIERS (yscr_tier, record.tier, caps.worst_tier, desc.min_tier)
 *     Each flip gets a tier from its backend, its path and the source of its
 *     onset, as measured on the one machine of STATUS:
 *       1  the OS observed the flip: DXGI_FLIP on the overlay or
 *          independent-flip path, COMPOSITION on independent flip
 *          (IndependentFlipFrame's displayed time sat within 0.1 ms of the
 *          scanout's own vblank, and moved with a late frame)
 *       2  good under conditions: DXGI_FLIP composed (DWM's vblank, one
 *          display), and any flip whose OS time was off the vblank grid
 *          (GRID_UNSTABLE: its onset is the grid's vblank)
 *       3  for task development only: an ESTIMATED or ONSET_PLANNED onset,
 *          such as every composed or overlay frame of COMPOSITION, whose
 *          time is DWM's plan for a vblank about 15 ms ahead
 *       YSCR_TIER_SIM  the simulated display
 *     A custom presenter may set the tier in each yscr_vblank; 0 takes the
 *     path's default. caps.worst_tier and the describe line give the worst
 *     tier since open. desc.min_tier (1 to 3) sets BELOW_TIER on each flip
 *     worse than it; the run goes on, and the caller decides what to do
 *     with those trials.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BACKENDS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   YSCR_BACKEND_AUTO (desc.backend 0)
 *     COMPOSITION where it opens and the presentation factory reports
 *     independent flip for the window's output (Windows 11 x64), else
 *     DXGI_FLIP. Decided 2026-10-09 on 10-minute runs that showed
 *     COMPOSITION no worse (docs/screen.md, "AUTO"). The describe line
 *     says backend=composition(auto), or backend=dxgi_flip(auto,
 *     composition-refused:"why"), and YSCR_EV_MODE's u.i32[5] is
 *     YSCR_AUTO_NAMED, _COMPOSITION or _FALLBACK. A backend named in
 *     desc.backend is opened or fails, as before.
 *   YSCR_BACKEND_DXGI_FLIP (Windows 10 and 11)
 *     SDL3 makes the window. The header makes a D3D11 device on the adapter
 *     whose output shows the window (on a laptop with two GPUs, the one
 *     wired to the panel; any other means a copy between adapters and a
 *     composed path), a DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_FLIP_DISCARD swapchain on the
 *     window, and an ANGLE display on that device
 *     (EGL_ANGLE_device_creation_d3d11). ANGLE renders into swapchain
 *     buffer 0 through a pbuffer (EGL_ANGLE_d3d_texture_client_buffer); in
 *     D3D11's flip model buffer 0 always names the current back buffer.
 *     The header does not use SDL's GL path on Windows: through it ANGLE
 *     makes a blt-model swapchain, which gives no vblank statistics, no
 *     frame latency control and no independent flip (docs/screen.md).
 *     libEGL.dll is loaded at run time from desc.angle_dir, else from the
 *     directory in the YSCR_ANGLE_DIR environment variable, else from the
 *     program's directory and the DLL search path; with a directory, the
 *     libGLESv2.dll beside it is the one used. The context is GL ES 3.0
 *     with an RGBA8 back buffer and no depth buffer. DXGI discards the back
 *     buffer at each present, so draw every pixel of every frame.
 *     A fullscreen screen is a borderless window over the display in its
 *     current mode, which DXGI promotes to an overlay plane or to
 *     independent flip; the record's path says which. A window is composed.
 *   YSCR_BACKEND_COMPOSITION (Windows 11, x64; open fails elsewhere)
 *     The same device, adapter choice and ANGLE context as DXGI_FLIP, but
 *     no swapchain: a presentation manager (IPresentationManager) shows our
 *     own 3 textures, each a client-buffer pbuffer for ANGLE, through a
 *     DirectComposition visual on the window. Each present carries a target
 *     time, so flip_at() never waits: measured, the system shows the frame
 *     on the vblank nearest the target, ties to the earlier one, which is
 *     ysp/timeline.h's rule, and the header passes the planned vblank's
 *     time itself. On independent flip the shortest lead that met its
 *     vblank was the next vblank; on the composed path, the one after. The
 *     target is QPC time in 100 ns units, not interrupt time, which is 20
 *     ms away from it on this machine (STATUS). Statistics: an independent
 *     flip reports its displayed time (tier 1); a composed or overlay frame
 *     reports a CompositionFrame, whose time the header reads from
 *     DComp's target statistics and flags ONSET_PLANNED (tier 3). A window
 *     that another window covers gets no statistic at all: such a flip
 *     completes after 3 periods as ESTIMATED and OCCLUDED. Without
 *     IPresentationSurface::SetSourceRect nothing showed; the header sets
 *     it. The header declares the COM interfaces itself, because dcomp.h
 *     is C++ only, MinGW-w64 has no presentation.h, and presentation.h's C
 *     declarations return SystemInterruptTime and LUID by value where the
 *     C++ methods return them through a hidden pointer;
 *     tests/compile/screen_com.cpp checks every slot against the SDK.
 *     AUTO picks it where it opens with independent flip.
 *   YSCR_BACKEND_SIM
 *     No window, no GL: a vblank grid on the ysp_rt clock with
 *     desc.sim_period_ns (default 1/60 s), which shows every frame on the
 *     vblank it was planned for. For tests, CI and dry runs of a timeline.
 *   YSCR_BACKEND_CUSTOM
 *     desc.presenter and desc.presenter_ctx: your swap path (PRESENTER).
 *   Not implemented in v0.3; open() refuses them with a message:
 *     YSCR_BACKEND_GLX_OML (Linux X11),
 *     YSCR_BACKEND_WAYLAND (presentation-time), YSCR_BACKEND_METAL
 *     (macOS through ANGLE), YSCR_BACKEND_WEB (requestAnimationFrame).
 *     On Linux and macOS only SIM and CUSTOM open.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PRESENTER (the swap-path interface)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A yscr_presenter is a table of functions, the Presenter extension
 *   of the rig: open, close, acquire (wait for a slot, bind the context),
 *   present (queue the frame for a vblank count and time), completions
 *   (the flips since the last call, oldest first, each with its present id,
 *   vblank time on the ysp_rt clock, vblank count, path, tier and flags;
 *   a time of 0 means "none", and SKIPPED or CANCELED means "never
 *   shown"), gl_proc, bind
 *   and describe. The core owns the window, the prediction, the snap, the
 *   decision when to present, the patch (unless the presenter sets
 *   draws_patch and paints the rectangle in present), drops, records and
 *   the ring. The presenter owns its OS objects and converts its times to
 *   the ysp_rt clock. Version 2 adds: yscr_present_req.codes, n_codes and
 *   verify (drawn after the patch by a presenter with draws_patch); in the
 *   open struct n_codes, want_gpu_done and three counters a presenter that
 *   reads codes back writes; and gpu_done(), the highest present id whose
 *   GPU work has finished, called from the trigger worker thread. The core calls a presenter from the thread that calls
 *   begin and flip, never from two threads at once; acquire may block,
 *   present and completions must not block past their OS call. A presenter
 *   with native_target in its caps shows a frame on req->target_count
 *   itself; otherwise the core waits before present. The header's timing
 *   statements end at this boundary for a presenter that is not its own.
 *   tests/adapt/screen_test.c has a complete one.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PHOTODIODE PATCH
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   desc.patch.on draws a square (desc.patch.size pixels, default 32) in
 *   desc.patch.corner, at the gray level yscr_set_patch() last set, on
 *   every frame, last, so it is on top. It is a scissored clear, never a
 *   draw call. On DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION it is
 *   ID3D11DeviceContext1::ClearView with one rectangle on the back buffer,
 *   after ANGLE's flush, and flip_at()
 *   changes no GL state at all. On a presenter without draws_patch the core
 *   clears through GL and changes, then restores, the draw framebuffer
 *   binding, GL_SCISSOR_TEST, the scissor box, the clear color, the color
 *   write mask and GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD; nothing else. The patch is for
 *   the loopback test: toggle it with the stimulus, and a photodiode on
 *   that corner measures when the frame appeared.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CODES (desc.codes, yscr_code, yscr_code_frames, yscr_code_row)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A code is a pixel value a device reads from the video signal, so the
 *   display itself times the trigger. desc.codes declares up to
 *   YSCR_MAX_CODES slots at open: a SOLID rectangle of one value, or a
 *   ROW of w pixels each with its own value (YSCR_CODE_ROW_PIXELS in all
 *   ROW slots together). Values are 0xBBGGRR, red in bits 0 to 7, exact
 *   device values (8 bits per channel). Each slot shows its rest value
 *   until you set it: yscr_code() for the next flip only,
 *   yscr_code_frames() for n flips or YSCR_CODE_HOLD, and
 *   yscr_code_row() for a ROW. Codes are drawn last, after your frame
 *   and after the patch, on every flip.
 *     Pixel Mode (VPixx VIEWPixx, VIEWPixx /EEG and /3D, DATAPixx and
 *       DATAPixx3, PROPixx): the device sets its digital outputs from the
 *       top-left pixel of each frame, bits 0 to 7 from red, 8 to 15 from
 *       green, 16 to 23 from blue, and holds them while the pixel stays.
 *       yscr_slot_pixel_mode() is that pixel; yscr_pixel_mode_bits()
 *       gives the value for 24 output bits. Turn the mode on with VPixx's
 *       own tools (Datapixx('EnablePixelMode') in Psychtoolbox).
 *     Pixel sync (VPixx): a register write on the device waits for a
 *       sequence of pixels on a chosen raster line (VPixx recommends at
 *       least 8). yscr_slot_psync() is where Psychtoolbox's PsychDataPixx
 *       draws it, 8 pixels on scanline 0 from x = 10, and
 *       yscr_psync_pattern() its values. The USB register side is not in
 *       this header.
 *     Bits# T-Lock packets fit a ROW slot; this header builds no packet.
 *   Drawing. DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION: a SOLID slot is one
 *   ID3D11DeviceContext1::ClearView; a ROW of up to 8 pixels is one
 *   ClearView per pixel, a longer one an UpdateSubresource (CODES in
 *   STATUS has the costs); after ANGLE's flush, so no GL state changes. On
 *   a presenter without draws_patch the core clears through GL, one
 *   scissored clear per SOLID slot and per ROW pixel, with the patch's
 *   save-and-restore list. open() refuses slots that overlap each other or
 *   the patch (the default top-left patch is on the Pixel Mode pixel: move
 *   it with desc.patch.corner), slots outside the display, and codes on a
 *   windowed screen, which is not at the display's origin.
 *   Exactness. At open, DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION draw all 256 values of
 *   each channel through both drawing paths into a test texture and read
 *   them back (selftest= in the describe line). desc.verify_codes = N
 *   copies the first row of each code to a staging texture every N flips
 *   and compares it one flip later (yscr_code_verify()). Both check the
 *   back buffer only. What happens after it, the header reports where it
 *   can, in record.code_risk (and YSCR_FLIP_CODE_AT_RISK in the flags):
 *     COMPOSED        this flip went through DWM
 *     ADVANCED_COLOR  HDR or auto color management is on (Windows
 *                     DisplayConfig); DWM and the display kernel convert
 *                     colors then
 *     GAMMA           the OS gamma ramp is not identity (OS GAMMA)
 *     SCALED          the mode is not the panel's preferred mode
 *     UNVERIFIED      the self test did not run (SIM, a custom presenter)
 *     VERIFY_FAILED   a read-back differed (sticky)
 *     STATE_UNKNOWN   the display state could not be read
 *   It cannot see Night Light, accessibility color filters, the MHC
 *   calibration pipeline (matrix and LUT at scanout), GPU dithering, or the
 *   display's own processing; the describe line says mhc=unknown and
 *   nightlight=unknown. Check on the rig with the device's own read-back
 *   (VPixx: the top line through vline). desc.codes_strict makes open()
 *   fail when a display-wide risk is set.
 *   The ring gets one YSCR_EV_CODE record per flip on a screen with
 *   codes: t_ns the onset, u.u32[0] the frame index, u.u16[2] code_risk,
 *   u.u16[3] the slot count, u.u32[2..9] the value of each slot (a ROW's
 *   first pixel).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   OS GAMMA (desc.keep_os_gamma)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A device value is only exact if nothing changes it after the back
 *   buffer. A fullscreen screen on Windows reads the display's gamma ramp
 *   at open (GetDeviceGammaRamp). If it is not the 8-bit identity, it sets
 *   the identity (SetDeviceGammaRamp) and reads it back. At close, at
 *   exit() (atexit) and when SDL posts its quit event, it puts back the
 *   ramp it read. A crash leaves the identity ramp until the next mode
 *   change, logoff or another program sets one. A window never touches
 *   the ramp; desc.keep_os_gamma = true leaves a fullscreen screen's ramp
 *   alone too. The panic watchdog puts the ramp back before it ends a hung
 *   process (PANIC). The describe line says os_gamma=identity (it was),
 *   set, refused (Windows did not take it), unreadable, or the same with
 *   (kept); anything but identity or set sets CODE_RISK_GAMMA.
 *   Microsoft documents limits on these calls: SetDeviceGammaRamp may
 *   return success and not set a ramp, other programs and the OS may
 *   overwrite it at any time, a display event resets it, and its behavior
 *   is undefined in HDR. The ramp is checked at open only: one read costs
 *   0.8 ms (measured), too much for the frame loop. Whether the ramp acts
 *   on frames shown by independent flip or on an overlay plane, and
 *   whether Night Light replaces it, was not measured (it needs light or
 *   a capture card); do not rely on it there. Out of reach of this header:
 *   the MHC calibration pipeline, Night Light, HDR and auto color
 *   management. Later work: CGSetDisplayTransferByTable (macOS), the RandR
 *   CRTC gamma (X11), and wlr-gamma-control on wlroots compositors
 *   (Wayland has no general protocol).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   TRIGGERS (desc.triggers, yscr_trigger, yscr_trigger_at)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   desc.triggers declares up to YSCR_MAX_TRIGGERS channels: a callback,
 *   its context and an offset. yscr_trigger(s, channel, code), between
 *   begin() and flip_at(), runs that callback at this flip's planned
 *   vblank + desc.onset_offset_ns + the channel's offset, on a deadline
 *   worker (ysp/rt.h WORKER) that open() starts when desc.n_triggers > 0.
 *   The callback runs on that thread, elevated; keep it to a port write:
 *       static void ttl(void* port, const yscr_trigger_info* i) {
 *           ypar_pulse_async((ypar_port*)port, (uint8_t)i->code, 2000);
 *       }
 *   ypar_pulse_async() writes the leading edge on the calling thread, here
 *   the worker at the deadline. yscr_trigger_at(s, channel, code, t)
 *   fires at time t, tied to no flip.
 *   When the header learns that a flip will be late, its triggers move:
 *     the caller was late    flip_at() planned a later vblank before the
 *                            trigger was armed (LATE_TARGET); no move
 *     the present returned   past the planned vblank's latch: the trigger
 *                            is armed for the vblank the frame can still
 *                            make (YSCR_TRIG_MOVED)
 *     the record completes   before the trigger fired, on another vblank:
 *                            it moves to that vblank (COMPOSITION's
 *                            composed path reports before the vblank)
 *     desc.trigger_fence     the worker checks a D3D11 fence 1 ms before
 *                            the deadline; GPU work not done means the
 *                            frame will miss, and the trigger moves one
 *                            vblank (YSCR_TRIG_GPU_MOVED). Off by
 *                            default (TRIGGERS in STATUS)
 *   A miss learned only from the statistic, after the trigger fired, is a
 *   mismatch: the result says FIRED_EARLY and by how many vblanks. A move
 *   never fires a trigger twice: a trigger the worker has taken cannot
 *   move, under one lock. close() stops the worker, which runs anything
 *   still armed at once with YSCR_TRIG_FLUSHED: a callback should not
 *   pulse then. A frame takes at most YSCR_MAX_JOBS triggers, and as
 *   many can be pending (YSCR_ERR_REFUSED beyond).
 *   Where the worker runs (desc.trigger_cpu). The rule: keep the worker
 *   off the CPUs that service the display's vblank DPC. A DPC runs ahead
 *   of every thread, at any priority, so a worker spinning on that CPU at
 *   the vblank waits for it. Which CPUs those are depends on the machine:
 *   the GPU, its driver, the interrupt affinity policy, the core types.
 *   This header knows one machine. On the laptop of STATUS (i7-1360P,
 *   Iris Xe) the DPC took 50 to 400 us from about 75 us before the vblank,
 *   2 to 3% of one P-core, on the P-core the worker spun on, and made
 *   about 1 trigger in 30 over 20 us late; on the E-cores it did not reach
 *   the worker (p99 1 to 3 us). So the default, on Windows on a hybrid
 *   CPU, is a hard affinity mask of the E-cores (with a soft E-core
 *   preference Windows still ran the worker on P-cores). That is this
 *   machine's answer, not a rule: on a CPU of one core type there are no
 *   E-cores and the default is ysp/rt.h's placement, and on another GPU or
 *   interrupt policy the E-cores may be the busy ones. Check it: run
 *   examples/screen/flipstats.c --trigger, which prints the late triggers
 *   per CPU, and read "% DPC Time" per processor (typeperf) during a run.
 *   k > 0 pins the worker to logical CPU k - 1 (a pinned worker cannot
 *   leave a busy CPU: measured up to 48 ms late); -1 leaves it where
 *   ysp/rt.h puts it (the P-cores of a hybrid CPU). The describe line
 *   says where: worker=TIME_CRITICAL/E-cores:cpus=0xff00, .../pinned:
 *   cpus=0x..., or .../ysp_rt. Later: at open, sample the DPC count of
 *   each CPU for about 0.5 s and place the worker away from the busiest.
 *   desc.trigger_spin_ns is the worker's spin window (ysp/rt.h WAITS).
 *   After a flip trigger fires, the worker arms itself 50 us before the
 *   next vblank's deadline, so the next frame's trigger needs no wake-up
 *   from the frame thread; when no trigger comes, that costs the worker
 *   one spin window for nothing.
 *   The ring gets one YSCR_EV_TRIGGER record per trigger when its flip
 *   has completed and it fired or was canceled: t_ns the fired time (the
 *   deadline if not fired), u.i64[0] the deadline, u.i64[1] the flip's
 *   onset, u.u32[4] the code, u.u32[5] the frame index, u.u16[12] the
 *   channel, u.u16[13] the flags, u.i32[7] the mismatch in vblanks,
 *   u.i32[8] fired minus deadline in ns.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   AFTER FLIP (yscr_on_flip)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yscr_on_flip(s, fn, ctx) calls fn with each completed record, oldest
 *   first, and the results of its triggers, on the frame thread, wherever
 *   records complete: begin(), wait_flip(), close(). For network markers
 *   (stamp them with the record's onset, not with "now"), logs, and
 *   trigger mismatches. It is late by design, by how long the record takes
 *   to complete (TRIGGERS in STATUS); on COMPOSITION's composed path it
 *   runs before the frame is on the screen, because the statistic is DWM's
 *   plan (ONSET_PLANNED). A trigger not fired yet when its record
 *   completes has YSCR_TRIG_PENDING. fn's time counts in begin().
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   NATIVE HANDLES (yscr_native)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yscr_native(s, &out) gives a DXGI_FLIP or COMPOSITION screen's
 *   D3D11 device, its immediate context, ANGLE's EGL display and the LUID
 *   of the adapter the device is on, for a library that shares textures
 *   with the screen (ysp/video.h's GPU path). Any other backend or
 *   platform: YSCR_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED and zeros.
 *     Lifetime  the pointers are borrowed: no reference is added. They are
 *               valid from open() to close(); keep none past close(), and
 *               release any object you made on the device before it.
 *     Threads   the device is free-threaded (created without
 *               D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_SINGLETHREADED): another thread may
 *               create resources on it. The immediate context is the frame
 *               thread's, shared with ANGLE: use it only on the frame
 *               thread, between begin() and flip_at(), and leave no state
 *               bound in it, because ANGLE caches the context's state and
 *               does not know of your calls.
 *     Video     desc.d3d11_video makes the device with
 *               D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_VIDEO_SUPPORT and turns on multithread
 *               protection (ID3D11Multithread::SetMultithreadProtected), so
 *               a decoder thread can use the device's video interfaces and
 *               its calls on the immediate context take turns with the
 *               frame thread's and ANGLE's. out.video and out.mt_protected
 *               say what the device has, read from the device. An adapter
 *               without D3D11 video support makes open() fail with a
 *               message; there is no fallback. The frame thread may queue
 *               ID3D11DeviceContext4::Wait() on a fence the decoder
 *               signals, between begin() and flip_at(): it holds back the
 *               GPU queue, not the thread. Cost, measured with no decoder
 *               on the device: no difference in the header's CPU time per
 *               frame (STATUS). With a decoder, each immediate-context call
 *               takes a lock the decoder may hold; ysp/video.h measures
 *               that. Off by default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   INPUT
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yscr_poll() is SDL_PollEvent() plus the event's time on the ysp_rt
 *   clock: SDL's event timestamp (SDL_GetTicksNS() units) moved onto the
 *   ysp_rt clock through a yrt_correlate() made at open and again every
 *   10 s. The correlation is exact to its width (0.1 us here); the event's
 *   own timestamp is what SDL gives.
 *   On Windows the header turns on SDL's raw keyboard path
 *   (SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_RAW_KEYBOARD, at default priority, so your own setting
 *   of the hint wins) and stops SDL text input, which would route keys
 *   through the message path. On the raw path SDL reads Raw Input on its
 *   own thread and stamps a key when it arrives: measured, keys sent with
 *   SendInput() were stamped 0.18 to 0.67 ms after the call. That
 *   stamp does not include the keyboard's scan, its USB polling interval
 *   (1 to 8 ms on common keyboards) or the HID stack, which were not
 *   measured. With the raw path off, SDL uses the message time, which
 *   counts in the system tick: measured, keys came out stamped from 6.2 ms
 *   before to 12.1 ms after the call. On X11 the server's 1 ms
 *   time, on Wayland the compositor's. Keyboards are not response boxes;
 *   use ysp/serial.h for reaction times.
 *   With the raw path on, SDL 3.4 also sends a key from the window message
 *   when the message carries no scan code (read in SDL 3.4.0's source):
 *   keys injected by virtual-key code (SendInput with wVk only), keys with
 *   no scan code (some media keys), some on-screen keyboards and remote
 *   tools. Measured with SendInput (examples/screen/input.c --reports, 518
 *   taps): a virtual-key tap gave two press-release pairs, the second
 *   -0.1 to 34.2 ms after the first; a 100 ms virtual-key hold gave one
 *   press and a repeat; scan-code injection gave one report, tapped or
 *   held. Keys from a keyboard carry scan codes, so they most likely
 *   report once; screen_input --hand checks keys pressed by hand.
 *   yscr_event_input() drops the second reports (v0.4.1, "Second key
 *   reports" below); SDL's own event stream keeps them.
 *   caps.raw_keyboard says whether keys come on the raw path now: on
 *   Windows, with a window, the hint on and text input off.
 *   Devices (v0.3.4). Keyboards on the raw path are per device: a key
 *   event's `which` is the keyboard's Raw Input handle, so two keyboards
 *   give two ids (ysp/response.h keeps them apart). Keys on the message
 *   path (text input on, the hint off, keys with no scan code) and keys
 *   from SendInput have which 0. Mice: SDL reads Raw Input for mice only in
 *   relative mode; in its absolute mode, the one ysp/screen.h uses, every
 *   mouse comes as one pointer, which 0, stamped with the message time
 *   (tier 3 in ysp/response.h). The abort and panic keys count every
 *   keyboard on purpose: the watchdog's low-level hook sees the system's
 *   keys, not a device. A screen with a window and desc.ring writes a
 *   YSCR_EV_DEVICE record for each device: t_ns the time it was logged,
 *   aux desc.display_index, u.u32[0] YSCR_DEV_KEYBOARD, _MOUSE, _GAMEPAD,
 *   _TOUCH or _PEN, u.u32[1] YSCR_DEV_PRESENT (listed at open), _ADDED
 *   or _REMOVED, u.u64[1] the id (SDL's: the keyboard's or mouse's `which`,
 *   a gamepad's instance id, a touch device's touchID, a pen's id), and its
 *   name in u.bytes[16..39] (YSCR_DEV_NAME_OF(e): NUL-terminated, cut at
 *   23 bytes; empty for a removal). Keyboards, mice and touch devices are
 *   listed at open, gamepads too with desc.gamepads; hot-plug comes from
 *   SDL's ADDED and REMOVED events as they pass through yscr_poll();
 *   pens and touch devices SDL did not list get a record when first used.
 *   One record per change: a table of 32 devices per screen drops SDL's
 *   ADDED events for devices it listed already (a full table logs every
 *   report). The ids are Windows handles on Windows: a keyboard unplugged
 *   and plugged in again gets a new id, and ids are not stable across
 *   sessions; map them through the names in the same log.
 *   Raw mice (desc.raw_mice, v0.3.5, Windows). One thread per process
 *   registers Raw Input for mice (usage page 1, usage 2) for a message-only
 *   window of its own, at time-critical priority, as SDL's thread does for
 *   the keyboard, and stamps each report when GetRawInputBuffer() returns
 *   (the reports of one call share the stamp). From v0.4.0 each report
 *   goes over the input bridge as ysp/input.h events (yin_from_mouse():
 *   presses, releases, a movement, a wheel; device the Raw Input handle,
 *   SDL's mouse id and the YSCR_EV_DEVICE id, 0 for injected input), so
 *   yscr_poll() and yscr_event_input() deliver them with everything
 *   else; a mouse SDL does not list gets YIN_UNLISTED. Movement is in
 *   counts, unaccelerated (no pointer ballistics: the system cursor moves
 *   by other rules). A tablet, remote desktop or a VM sends positions
 *   instead (YIN_AXIS_ABSOLUTE, 0..1 of the primary display or the
 *   virtual desktop). yscr_poll_mouse() is DEPRECATED (v0.4.0, goes in
 *   v0.5): it reads the raw mouse records straight from the bridge's
 *   store, one event of a report per call (v0.3.5 gave a whole report),
 *   and their doorbells then decode as already taken. u.u32[1] of the
 *   YSCR_EV_RAW_MICE records counts the bridge's overwritten records.
 *   SDL keeps its own mouse events: the system cursor,
 *   clicks on other windows, the focus, Dear ImGui and an operator console
 *   work as before.
 *   Focus: registered without RIDEV_INPUTSINK, so reports come only while
 *   this process is in front. A participant's clicks while another program
 *   has the focus are not taken; an operator window of this process (an
 *   ImGui panel included) keeps the process in front. RIDEV_INPUTSINK was
 *   measured working and is not used: it would take every click on the
 *   desktop.
 *   Devices: SDL lists the mice it recognizes; Windows listed the same 3
 *   here. A precision touchpad's cursor, injected input and remote desktop
 *   come with no device handle: device 0, which cannot be told apart from
 *   each other (a touchpad is a digitizer; its fingers are a touch source,
 *   not a mouse). A report from a device SDL does not list gets
 *   YSCR_MOUSE_UNLISTED and, the first time, a YSCR_EV_DEVICE record
 *   (added, named "raw, not in SDL's list"); filter on the flag.
 *   Relative mode: Raw Input registration is per process and per usage.
 *   SDL's relative mode takes the mice while on and removes the
 *   registration for the whole process when it ends (measured). open()
 *   refuses raw_mice while any SDL window is in relative mode. Later, a
 *   guard in begin() reads the window's relative mode every frame (23 ns
 *   measured) and the registration when that changes and every 30th frame
 *   (GetRegisteredRawInputDevices, 0.4 to 11 us measured; 291 ns per frame
 *   on average): while relative mode is on, no raw reports come (SDL's
 *   mouse events carry the device then) and a YSCR_EV_RAW_MICE record
 *   says SUSPENDED; when it ends, or when other code took the mice, the
 *   reader registers again and the record says REGISTERED. Each screen with
 *   raw_mice shares the one reader; the last to close stops it. On other
 *   platforms, and with no window, open() refuses raw_mice. Measured with
 *   injected input only (examples/screen/input.c --mice is the hand test
 *   for two physical mice): reports stamped 0.15 to 0.40 ms after
 *   SendInput (means of three runs), no report lost or doubled with SDL's
 *   raw keyboard running.
 *   The input bridge (v0.4.0). One loop for every input: a producer on any
 *   thread (desc.raw_mice's reader, a response-box reader, an eye tracker)
 *   calls yscr_push_input(&e) with a ysp/input.h event stamped on the
 *   ysp_rt clock. The header stores it (a store of YSCR_INPUT_STORE
 *   records, 4096 unless defined before the implementation, one per
 *   process) and pushes one SDL event of type yscr_input_event_type()
 *   (registered at the first open with SDL), its user.code the record's
 *   sequence number: a doorbell. yscr_poll() returns doorbells in SDL's
 *   stream like any event; ImGui and other SDL consumers see the stream
 *   unchanged (they ignore an event type they do not know). Then
 *       while (yscr_poll(&scr, &ev, &t)) {
 *           ImGui_ImplSDL3_ProcessEvent(&ev);                  // optional
 *           if (yscr_event_input(&scr, &ev, &in)) yrsp_feed(&rsp, &in);
 *       }
 *   yscr_event_input() gives a doorbell's own record (keyed by the
 *   sequence, so a doorbell decoded late, out of order or never does not
 *   shift any other) and converts SDL's keyboard, mouse, touch, pen and
 *   gamepad events through ysp/input.h's adapter, with the screen's raw
 *   keyboard state and the ysp_rt time. A bridged event keeps the
 *   producer's stamp; SDL's push time is never used for it.
 *   Order: one producer's events come in its push order. Against SDL's own
 *   events, a doorbell sits where SDL queued it, so the stream is arrival
 *   order to within one pump of SDL's queue; every event carries its
 *   time, and ysp/response.h reads times, not order.
 *   Overflow: a record nobody decodes stays until the store wraps; then the
 *   newest overwrites it (counted), and its doorbell, if decoded later,
 *   returns false and counts as lost. Overwriting the oldest, not refusing
 *   the newest, keeps a skipped doorbell from holding its slot forever.
 *   SDL's queue takes 65,535 events (measured); a doorbell it refuses is
 *   counted, its record kept, and yscr_poll() pushes it again, oldest
 *   first, when SDL's queue is empty, so it arrives late but arrives.
 *   begin() writes a YSCR_EV_INPUT_LOST ring record when the counts of
 *   overwritten records, refused doorbells or lost decodes move (u.u32[0]
 *   to [3]: overwritten, refused, lost, still waiting; totals);
 *   yscr_get_input_stats() reads them. yscr_push_input() is for any
 *   thread; yscr_poll() and yscr_event_input() for one thread.
 *   Measured (AC, the timing guard, a 320 x 200 window): 4 producer
 *   threads at about 1 kHz each, 8000 events, every one decoded once and
 *   in each producer's order, none lost; yscr_push_input() 1.9 to 2.6 us
 *   with a window (SDL_PushEvent calls the event watches and wakes the
 *   queue), yscr_event_input() on a doorbell 74 to 81 ns, the doorbell's
 *   whole poll and decode 410 to 424 ns (SDL_PollEvent pumps the window's
 *   messages). 70,000 pushes with no poll: SDL refused 4465 doorbells, the
 *   store kept the newest 4096 records, all decoded over the next 3
 *   frames, and 65,535 doorbells of overwritten records counted lost. Raw
 *   mice through the bridge: 30 of 30 injected moves, with SDL's keys in
 *   the same loop.
 *   Second key reports (v0.4.1). yscr_event_input() returns false for a
 *   second report of a key press, so every consumer of the loop above
 *   gets one press per key, not only ysp/response.h's collector. The rule,
 *   on keyboard events from SDL (either path) and from doorbells alike:
 *     - a key-down that is not an OS repeat, of the same key (scancode)
 *       as a key-down kept less than desc.key_dedup_ns (0 = 50 ms) before
 *       or after it, from the same keyboard or with either device 0 (the
 *       message path and injected input have device 0), is dropped;
 *     - after such a drop, the first key-up of that key that finds no
 *       kept key-down still down is dropped too, so the consumer sees one
 *       down and one up; the kept press's own key-up passes, whichever
 *       comes first, and a key-up is paired with a kept key-down of its
 *       own device before one with device 0;
 *     - a key-up with device 0 is dropped first where a press kept with a
 *       keyboard's id has a dropped report pending (v0.4.2): the kept
 *       press's own key-up has that id, so this one is the second
 *       report's, also while another keyboard holds the same key;
 *     - an OS repeat (YIN_REPEAT) passes: SDL's key state marks the second
 *       report of a held key so, and a consumer's held-key rule reads it;
 *     - a key-down with the same time, device and key as the one kept is
 *       that report decoded again and passes, so two calls on one SDL
 *       event give the event twice.
 *   Why 50 ms: the largest measured gap was 34.2 ms (518 virtual-key
 *   taps), and one finger does not press one key twice within 50 ms
 *   (stated, not measured here). The first report to arrive is kept, not
 *   the earliest stamp: SDL queues the raw report first, and the message
 *   report's stamp is tick-quantized (-0.1 ms is in the table). Each drop
 *   counts in yscr_get_input_stats() (key_doubles, key_double_ups) and,
 *   on a screen with desc.ring, writes a YSCR_EV_KEY_DOUBLE record for a
 *   dropped key-down: t_ns the dropped report's time, aux
 *   desc.display_index, u.i64[0] its time minus the kept report's (ns),
 *   u.u32[2] the scancode, u.u32[3] its device, u.u32[4] the kept
 *   report's device. The table holds the 16 keys pressed last, for the
 *   process (SDL's queue is one stream for every window); s NULL uses 50
 *   ms. desc.key_dedup_ns < 0 turns it off for that screen's calls:
 *   every report, as SDL gives it. yscr_key_filter() applies the same
 *   rule, and the same table, to an event that did not come from
 *   yscr_event_input() (your own adapter, a simulated participant); never
 *   call it on an event yscr_event_input() returned. SDL's own events,
 *   read by Dear ImGui or by SDL_PollEvent(), are not changed. Measured
 *   with the core test only: no key was injected through it in a window.
 *   Gamepads (desc.gamepads): open() starts SDL_INIT_GAMEPAD and opens each
 *   gamepad; yscr_poll() opens one on SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_ADDED and closes
 *   it on SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_REMOVED (so read events with yscr_poll(), not
 *   SDL_PollEvent()); close() closes them and stops the subsystem. Up to 8
 *   gamepads. A screen with no window (SIM) does not start it. The stamps
 *   of gamepad events depend on SDL's driver for the pad (XInput is
 *   polled; Raw Input, HIDAPI and GameInput are not) and were not
 *   measured. Off by default: open() starts SDL's video subsystem only.
 *   Text input (yscr_text_input): a text box needs SDL text input
 *   (SDL_EVENT_TEXT_INPUT, and SDL_EVENT_TEXT_EDITING for an input method's
 *   composition), which open() stops. yscr_text_input(s, true, x, y, w,
 *   h) starts it on the screen's window and puts the IME candidate window
 *   by the rectangle x, y, w, h (window pixels, the caret's line); false
 *   stops it. Call it again while on to move the rectangle with the caret.
 *   While it is on, keys go through the message path: their times are not
 *   the raw path's (see above), so a typed response is untimed. Each change
 *   of on or off writes a YSCR_EV_TEXT_INPUT ring record (t_ns the call,
 *   aux desc.display_index, u.u32[0] 1 on or 0 off, u.i32[1..4] x, y, w, h,
 *   u.u32[5] 0), and every flip planned while it is on has
 *   YSCR_FLIP_TEXT_INPUT in its record (not in the ring's mode word,
 *   which holds 10 flag bits). On a screen with no window (SIM) only the
 *   record and the flag change.
 *   The state is observed, not only commanded: another library can start
 *   text input on the window (Dear ImGui's SDL3 backend does, on whichever
 *   window has the focus; docs/imgui_probe.md measured its keys 11.4 ms
 *   late). flip_at() reads SDL_TextInputActive() and, when it differs from
 *   the last logged state, writes the same record with u.u32[5] 1
 *   (external; t_ns when flip_at() saw it, the rectangle 0) before it sets
 *   the flip's flag. A change between two flips is seen at the next one,
 *   so the flag can be a frame late; caps.raw_keyboard reads the state at
 *   once.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ABORT (desc.abort_keys, yscr_request_abort, f.abort)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   An abort asks the frame loop to stop; the header never stops it. Each
 *   abort is reported once: the next begin() returns YSCR_QUIT with
 *   f.abort (the reasons, ORed), f.abort_presses and f.abort_ns (the first
 *   one's time), and every other field of f 0. The begin() after that
 *   starts a frame again. The caller decides: save and close, or ask the
 *   operator and go on. The header calls no exit() and closes no window.
 *     YSCR_ABORT_KEY      the abort combination, Shift+Esc by default.
 *                           Esc alone does nothing, so a participant who
 *                           hits Esc does not end the session. A held key
 *                           is one press: repeats do not count
 *     YSCR_ABORT_CLOSE    a close request for a screen's window: the
 *                           close button, the taskbar, Task Manager's "End
 *                           task"
 *     YSCR_ABORT_ALT_F4   Alt+F4. The header sets
 *                           SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_CLOSE_ON_ALT_F4 to "0" (at
 *                           default priority), so it is not a close request
 *     YSCR_ABORT_QUIT     SDL's quit event: Ctrl+C in the console, a
 *                           logoff, the last window closed (with CLOSE)
 *     YSCR_ABORT_REQUEST  yscr_request_abort(), from any thread: an
 *                           operator console, a response-box button
 *   desc.abort_keys sets the combination: .key is an SDL keycode (0 =
 *   Esc); .mods are the YSCR_MOD_* that must be held (0 = Shift;
 *   YSCR_MOD_NONE = the key alone, for development; more modifiers held
 *   still count); .off turns the key off (the other reasons stay). There is
 *   one combination per process: open() refuses a desc that differs from
 *   an open screen's. The describe line says abort=shift+esc.
 *   The header sees each event as SDL queues it (SDL_AddEventWatch), so
 *   an abort counts although your code read the event first with
 *   yscr_poll() or SDL_PollEvent(). An SDL event filter that drops the
 *   event hides it. Reports of one press within 50 ms (SDL's two, INPUT,
 *   and the panic watchdog's) are one press. The aborts wait in a log of
 *   16 per process; a screen opened later does not see the earlier ones.
 *   A group reports an abort in every f[i], and no member begins a frame.
 *   The ring gets one YSCR_EV_ABORT record per abort, when begin()
 *   reports it: t_ns the press (or the request), aux desc.display_index,
 *   u.u32[0] the reason, u.u32[1] who saw it (1 the watchdog's hook, 2
 *   injected input, 4 SDL), u.u32[2] the key, u.u32[3] the modifiers,
 *   u.i64[2] when begin() reported it.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PANIC (desc.panic): Shift+Esc 3 times when the program hangs
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   An abort works only while the frame loop calls begin(). A program that
 *   hangs in fullscreen leaves a fullscreen window, a switched display
 *   mode and the OS gamma ramp the header set. desc.panic arms a watchdog
 *   for that: a thread with a low-level keyboard hook (WH_KEYBOARD_LL),
 *   which sees the abort combination whatever the frame thread does. The
 *   hook passes every key on, so SDL still sees the same keys, and press 1
 *   is an abort either way.
 *   The rule: desc.panic_presses (0 = 3) presses within
 *   desc.panic_window_ms (0 = 2000), with a window of this process in
 *   front (or the "Ghost" window Windows puts in front of a hung one after
 *   about 5 s, measured), and no abort reported by a begin() for
 *   desc.panic_grace_ms (0 = 10000). A responsive loop reports press 1
 *   within a frame, so presses 2 and 3 are more aborts, and a program that
 *   saves after press 1 is not killed. A program outside its frame loop
 *   (loading, saving) for longer than the grace time looks hung.
 *   The panic, on the watchdog thread: it removes the hook, so no key of
 *   the session waits on it; writes a YSCR_EV_PANIC record to each armed
 *   screen's ring (t_ns the panic, u.u32[0] the presses needed, u.i64[1]
 *   the last report); puts back each gamma ramp the header set; calls
 *   desc.panic_fn(desc.panic_ctx) on a thread of its own, at most 1 s; and
 *   ends the process with TerminateProcess(YSCR_PANIC_EXIT_CODE = 99).
 *   Windows puts back a display mode the screen switched as the process
 *   ends (measured: 1.2 s after press 3, teardown included).
 *   ChangeDisplaySettingsExW from the watchdog was measured too: it waited
 *   over 1 s on the hung window and brought the mode back no sooner, so
 *   the watchdog does not call it.
 *   Not exit(): exit runs atexit handlers and DLL detach, which can wait
 *   on locks the hung thread holds, and only the end of the process takes
 *   down a window and a swapchain that a hung thread owns.
 *   What another thread can put back: the gamma ramps (GDI, by the
 *   display's name) and ring records. What it cannot: the window,
 *   fullscreen and the display mode (a call on a window, or a display
 *   change, waits for the hung thread; the end of the process ends them);
 *   the D3D11 device, ANGLE and
 *   SDL (not safe while the frame thread is inside them); data not yet
 *   written (panic_fn may save some, but runs while the frame thread holds
 *   what it holds, so it must take no lock the frame loop uses); hardware
 *   a trigger left set (panic_fn may reset it).
 *   When it is armed: DXGI_FLIP and COMPOSITION in fullscreen, on
 *   Windows. A window has no ramp or mode to put back and its user has the
 *   desktop: the describe line says panic=idle(windowed); on SIM, CUSTOM
 *   and other platforms, panic=n/a. open() refuses desc.panic with
 *   abort_keys.off and with a key the hook cannot name (it takes Esc, F1
 *   to F12, a letter or a digit). The first armed screen's numbers hold
 *   until the last armed screen closes.
 *   Cost: while it is armed, every key of the session goes through the
 *   watchdog thread, which otherwise sleeps in GetMessage. Windows skips a
 *   hook that takes longer than LowLevelHooksTimeout (at most 1 s); this
 *   hook does a few compares and takes no lock the frame thread holds. A
 *   test hook that stalled for 1.5 s once was still called afterwards, so
 *   the header does not install it again. Keys on SDL's raw path were not
 *   stamped later with the hook armed (STATUS).
 *   Measured (examples/screen/abort.c; a window armed through a test
 *   seam, and fullscreen in a switched mode): see STATUS.
 *   Later, X11: the watchdog opens its own display connection and selects
 *   XI_RawKeyPress and XI_RawKeyRelease on the root window (XInput 2.1),
 *   which arrive whatever has the focus and are not consumed. It checks
 *   _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW, puts back the CRTC gamma through RandR on its own
 *   connection (and the mode, unless the X server does as the process
 *   ends, to be measured), and ends with _exit(). Wayland has no global key
 *   events: no panic there; the compositor undoes a dead client's
 *   fullscreen.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   WINDOW ICON (desc.icon_rgba, desc.icon_sdl)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   open() gives each window the header's own icon, Escher's impossible
 *   cube, drawn for this header (public domain, like the rest), at 16, 32
 *   and 48 pixels: SDL_SetWindowIcon with alternate images, so Windows
 *   takes the size its display scale needs. It is stored as a 5-color
 *   palette and runs of 4-bit indices (1312 bytes in all), decoded at
 *   open. desc.icon_rgba (icon_w x icon_h RGBA, top row first, 1 to 256 a
 *   side) sets yours; desc.icon_sdl keeps SDL's.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   DISPLAYS AND MODES
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yscr_displays() and yscr_modes() list what SDL reports, the
 *   refresh as a rational (refresh_num / refresh_den Hz) and as a period.
 *   desc.mode all zero opens in the desktop mode and never switches. A
 *   desc.mode with any field set must match a mode yscr_modes() lists
 *   (a refresh is compared as a rational), or open() fails: there is no
 *   nearest-mode fallback. A matching mode other than the desktop's
 *   switches the display for the life of the screen. yscr_caps.mode is
 *   the mode read back from the OS after the switch. For a video at 23.976
 *   or 59.94 Hz, yscr_mode_multiple() finds the mode whose refresh is a
 *   multiple of it, and its error in ppm.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MULTIPLE DISPLAYS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   One yscr_screen per display (desc.display), each with its own device,
 *   context, swap path, grid and records; desc.display_index tells their
 *   records apart. yscr_begin_group() and yscr_flip_group_at() run a
 *   frame on all of them from one thread: a DXGI wait is a kernel object,
 *   so waiting on each in turn costs the longest wait, not the sum. Two
 *   displays that flip together is a claim about hardware: only genlock
 *   on a workstation GPU makes it, and two photodiodes measure it. The
 *   group calls do not synchronize anything; each record has its own onset.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   VARIABLE REFRESH
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A capability, never a default. yscr_caps.vrr_capable reports whether
 *   DXGI allows tearing presents, which a variable-refresh panel needs and
 *   which does not prove the panel has it. desc.vrr makes open() fail:
 *   v0.1 does not run variable refresh, which needs the photodiode
 *   interval sweep and the luminance-versus-interval sweep on that panel
 *   first. The header always presents with a sync interval of 1 and never
 *   with tearing. A driver that varies the refresh on its own shows up as
 *   off-grid times (YSCR_FLIP_GRID_UNSTABLE) and as a warning in the
 *   describe line; once most times are off the grid, the grid follows
 *   them (THE GRID).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SYNC GUARD
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A driver panel can force vsync off for every program: AMD Software
 *   "Wait for Vertical Refresh: Always off", NVIDIA Control Panel
 *   "Vertical sync: Off", Intel Graphics "Vertical Sync: Speed", and on
 *   Linux Mesa's vblank_mode=0. Whether a panel overrides a flip-model
 *   Present(1) is not measured (docs/screen.md, "Driver-forced vsync
 *   off"). If one does, frames tear or are discarded, and the onsets are
 *   not measurements. The guard looks at every flip that has an OS time
 *   (after open's black frames, and not while the window is occluded) for
 *   evidence that is impossible under vsync:
 *     - same refresh: its vblank count is not after the previous flip's,
 *       or its time is less than half a period after it;
 *     - no wait: it flipped in the refresh its present call was made in
 *       (the count is not after the count at the call, and the time is
 *       before the call: DXGI's count lost vblanks while frames were
 *       held, so it can be one behind the grid's count at the call);
 *     - torn: its time is more than a quarter period before the vblank
 *       its count names, on the grid it was planned with.
 *   It fires when 32 of the last 64 such flips have evidence (FLIPS), or
 *   when, over a block of at least 64 refreshes between such flips, more
 *   presents completed (shown, estimated or skipped) than the refreshes
 *   plus 8, the frames that can be in flight (RATE). The rate catches a
 *   driver that discards frames without tearing: their statistics are
 *   missing, so they complete as ESTIMATED and look shown.
 *   Legitimate cases give no evidence: a held frame or a drop shows fewer
 *   frames than refreshes; COMPOSITION's present at a time and the SIM
 *   backend show each frame on a vblank of its own after its present;
 *   DXGI's off-grid times of held frames (GRID_UNSTABLE) gave a torn
 *   flip now and then, never many in a row. One stale count or
 *   jittered time is one flip of 32. tests/adapt/screen_test.c plays a
 *   forced-off driver four ways (each fires) and the legitimate paths
 *   (none fires). On this laptop's DXGI_FLIP, with load, misses and held
 *   frames, at most 3 of 64 flips had evidence; on COMPOSITION, none
 *   (docs/screen.md, "Driver-forced vsync off").
 *   When it fires, once per open: the screen is untimed. Every record
 *   from the flip that fired it on carries YSCR_FLIP_UNSYNCED and tier 3
 *   (so desc.min_tier flags it, and caps.worst_tier is 3). The ring gets
 *   one YSCR_EV_UNSYNCED record; the describe line says
 *   WARNING=not-vsynced(driver-setting?); yscr_sync_check() returns the
 *   rule, the frame, the evidence counts and a message to show the
 *   operator. The run goes on: only the caller knows what to do with its
 *   trials. Limit: a driver that tears but reports the next vblank's
 *   count and time gives no evidence; examples/screen/sync_check.c shows
 *   tearing to the eye.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PARAMETERS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yscr_params() returns a table of the desc fields a designer sets:
 *   name, type, range, the value a zero field means, unit and one line of
 *   text.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The handle holds everything; nothing is allocated after open(), and
 *   the frame loop makes no allocation of its own (measured: 0 C runtime
 *   heap calls from the header in a debug build). The handle is about 22
 *   KB, most of it the code rows and the depth evidence. One thread calls
 *   begin, flip and the rest for a screen. open() and close() of different
 *   screens must not run at the same time, because ANGLE's libEGL is
 *   loaded once per process and never unloaded. open() starts a thread
 *   only when desc.n_triggers > 0: the trigger worker (TRIGGERS), which
 *   close() stops; and, once per process, the panic watchdog when an armed
 *   screen opens (PANIC), which the last armed screen's close() stops. The
 *   abort state is one per process (ABORT). Raise the frame thread with
 *   yrt_thread_elevate() before open.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Link SDL3 (3.2 or later); with CMake, find_package(SDL3) and link
 *   SDL3::SDL3. The implementation includes <SDL3/SDL.h>, and on Windows
 *   <d3d11_1.h> and <dxgi1_5.h> from the Windows SDK or MinGW-w64. It
 *   links nothing else: d3d11.dll, dxgi.dll, user32.dll and libEGL.dll are
 *   loaded at run time. It does not include SDL_main.h, so your main() is
 *   yours. Put libEGL.dll and libGLESv2.dll from an ANGLE build beside the
 *   program, or name their directory in desc.angle_dir or YSCR_ANGLE_DIR.
 *   Link libm on Linux, and include ysp/screen.h (or ysp/rt.h) before any
 *   system header in the implementation file: ysp/rt.h sets the
 *   feature-test macro that glibc reads at the first one.
 *   Define YSCR_NO_SDL to build without SDL: the core, SIM and CUSTOM
 *   only, with no window, no input and no GL. tests/adapt/screen_test.c
 *   builds this way.
 *   Define YSCR_API to change the linkage of every function.
 *   Hot paths carry ysp/rt.h's instrumentation macros: zones yscr.begin,
 *   yscr.wait, yscr.pump, yscr.stats, yscr.flip, yscr.patch,
 *   yscr.present and yscr.hold; a frame mark when a flip's record
 *   completes; plots of the residual and the depth.
