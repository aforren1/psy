/* ysp/trials.h - v0.2.1 - public domain single-header trial sequencing library
 *
 *   The layer above the adaptive methods: which trial comes next, and what
 *   happened on it. Conditions and repetitions (the method of constant
 *   stimuli), sequential, random and constrained-random orders ("no more
 *   than three of the same orientation in a row", "a catch trial at most
 *   once in any six trials"), interleaved adaptive tracks (staircases,
 *   QUEST+, GP handles owned by the caller), blocks, practice trials, catch
 *   trials, re-queued trials, per-condition tallies, and a history that
 *   replays. PsychoPy's TrialHandler and MultiStairHandler, as one C
 *   header with no heap. From v0.2: conditions files and trial lists as
 *   tables (CSV or a pack), order lists, draws with replacement, subsets,
 *   blocked and alternating groups in Latin-square order, units that run
 *   back to back ("b always follows a"), first-order transition balance,
 *   and a rules text that sets all of it by column and level names.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no OS calls, no threads, no heap, no I/O. REQUIRES
 *   ysp/table.h beside it (v0.2; its implementation is compiled with this
 *   one's, as ysp/gfx.h does ysp/color.h's), and otherwise only the C
 *   standard library (snprintf for the format functions). It does not
 *   include the method headers: a track is an opaque pointer and an
 *   is-done callback, so this header interleaves anything and knows nothing
 *   about stimuli or levels.
 *
 *   Targets every platform the compiler does. C99 is the floor: it builds as
 *   C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.2.1 - jitter: a random duration per trial (a foreperiod, an ITI,
 *          an SOA), drawn from the session's generator in a fixed order, so
 *          restore() and load() reproduce it, and logged in the data line
 *          (JITTER). Uniform on an interval, uniform over a list
 *          (ytr_choice()), and an exponential truncated to an interval
 *          (a non-aging foreperiod); any of them snapped to whole frames of
 *          a rate num/den. In seconds, also as int64 nanoseconds and frame
 *          counts. Every draw is integer arithmetic on the variate's 53
 *          bits (a fixed-point logarithm for the exponential), so it is the
 *          same nanosecond on every C library, compiler and flag set.
 *          desc.jitters[] with per-condition intervals from table
 *          columns, ytr_jitter() and ytr_jitter_index(); call-level
 *          ytr_jitter_draw(), ytr_jitter_map(), ytr_jitter_check();
 *          the rules statement `jitter`.
 *          - Every v0.2.0 desc gives the same schedule, draws, history,
 *            records, tallies, format lines (but the version token) and
 *            snapshot bytes as v0.2.0: tests/adapt/trials_pins_v02.h
 *            holds the hashes of 320 sessions (16 v0.2 designs x 20 seeds)
 *            made by v0.2.0, beside the 600 of v0.1.1.
 *          - Snapshot format 3 for a desc with jitters (format 2 plus the
 *            jitters and their draws); formats 1 and 2 as before.
 *          - The handle grew by 8 bytes per trial per YTR_MAX_JITTERS (4):
 *            243344 bytes at the defaults on a 64-bit ABI. Define
 *            YTR_MAX_JITTERS lower to save it.
 *   v0.2.0 - tables, sampling, groups, units, balance, Latin squares, rules
 *          text. Every v0.1 desc gives the same schedule, draws, history,
 *          records, tallies, format lines (but the version token) and
 *          snapshot bytes as v0.1.1: tests/adapt/trials_pins.h holds
 *          the hashes of 600 sessions (30 designs x 20 seeds) made by
 *          v0.1.1, and the test checks them.
 *          - REQUIRES ysp/table.h. desc.table: a table's rows are the
 *            conditions and its columns the factors (TABLES).
 *          - YTR_ORDER_LIST and YTR_ORDER_WITH_REPLACEMENT, desc.subset
 *            (ORDER LISTS, DRAWS, SUBSETS); desc.groups (GROUPS).
 *          - Structural rules ytr_followed_by(), ytr_preceded_by(),
 *            ytr_chunk() (STRUCTURE: UNITS); ytr_balance(),
 *            ytr_balance_no_repeat(), ytr_balance_flags() (BALANCE);
 *            ytr_latin() (LATIN SQUARES); ytr_rules() and
 *            ytr_format_rules() (GRAMMAR).
 *          - YTR_FLAG_LEADIN on the lead-in of a balanced order. No
 *            field was added to ytr_trial_info, so a positional
 *            initializer of it stays warning-free (the history flag and
 *            rep -1 tell the lead-in).
 *          - Snapshot format 2 for a desc with any v0.2 field; format 1,
 *            the v0.1.1 bytes, for any other. load() takes the format the
 *            desc implies.
 *          - format_meta() adds the v0.2 keys (the table's hash among them)
 *            after the v0.1 ones, and only for a desc with a v0.2 field;
 *            format_header() and format_row() add a `leadin` column only for
 *            a balanced order with a lead-in.
 *          - The handle grew by 19 KB (scratch for open() and the units'
 *            run-time moves, the table's level pointers): 110528 bytes at the
 *            defaults on a 64-bit ABI.
 *          - A desc that puts an out-of-range value in an enum field is
 *            still refused; in C++ such a value must lie in the enum's bit
 *            range or reading it is undefined (the test now respects that).
 *   v0.1.1 - hardening for newer compilers (gcc 13 and 16, clang 18 at -O3
 *          with warnings as errors), no change to any order, draw or
 *          snapshot byte. Every loop over a fixed-size array is bounded by
 *          the array's size as well as its count, every memmove size is
 *          visibly nonnegative and inside the arrays, and open() copies
 *          desc.cond_reps and desc.warmup_conditions into the handle,
 *          reading each entry once, so neither needs to outlive open().
 *          open() now rejects n_warmup_conditions above
 *          YTR_MAX_CONDITIONS. The handle grew by 4 KB.
 *   v0.1.0 - first implementation. Defining YSP_TRIALS_IMPLEMENTATION now
 *          compiles the library instead of failing. The manual gained what
 *          a specification could leave open and an implementation cannot:
 *          the exact generator draw order (RANDOMNESS), the snapshot byte
 *          layout, how blocks are counted and where practice sits, what a
 *          constraint window does at a block boundary (it is clipped),
 *          what ytr_requeue() does to the schedule and the block count,
 *          and the rest of the descs ytr_open() rejects. Behavior that
 *          differs from the v0.0 text:
 *          - Constraints hold on the MAIN sequence (every trial but
 *            practice and warmup, track trials included as trials with no
 *            level), and next() enforces them at run time as well as at
 *            open: a scheduled trial that would break one gives way to a
 *            track trial, or to a later scheduled trial that fits. Without
 *            that, the second USAGE example (one catch condition and three
 *            tracks) could not be expressed. With tracks, a repair that
 *            runs out of swaps is therefore not an open() failure.
 *          - The repair swaps the offending trial with the first of up to
 *            64 slots, from a random start, that leaves both slots legal,
 *            not with a blind random later slot: the blind swap failed
 *            about 15% of easy designs (3 rows x 10, no immediate repeat)
 *            by getting trapped at the end of the schedule.
 *          - YTR_ANY_LEVEL works for max_in_window and min_gap as well
 *            as max_run. no_transition is clipped at block boundaries like
 *            the others; first_not is about the session's first main
 *            trial only.
 *          - ytr_requeue() records the new outcome YTR_REQUEUE (-2),
 *            and ytr_restore() re-queues on YTR_REQUEUE, not on
 *            YTR_INVALID, so update(YTR_INVALID) and requeue() replay
 *            differently and the history's outcomes feed restore directly.
 *            update() rejects outcomes below YTR_INVALID.
 *          - Practice and warmup trials cannot be re-queued (YTR_ERR_ARG).
 *          - Two history flags: YTR_FLAG_FIRST_IN_BLOCK and
 *            YTR_FLAG_VIOLATION.
 *          - ytr_format_row() and ytr_format_header() add warmup and
 *            after_break columns, and end the line with a newline.
 *          - A record pointer with no records buffer is ignored rather
 *            than an error, and a NULL record zero-fills the trial's slot.
 *          - ytr_condition_at() indexes the practice slots too.
 *   v0.0 - specification. Declarations and the manual, no implementation.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.2.1, 2026-10-07. The jitter release, built and run as
 *   v0.2.0 below (gcc 16.1 C11, C99, C++17; MSVC 19.44 C and C++17; WSL2
 *   gcc 11.4 C11 and C++17 under ASan and UBSan; YTR_MAX_TRIALS 256) and
 *   at YTR_MAX_JITTERS 1. The 600 v0.1.1 pins and 320 new v0.2.0 pins
 *   (tests/adapt/trials_pins_v02.h: 16 v0.2 designs x 20 seeds, made
 *   by v0.2.0) match on every build, so no earlier draw moved.
 *   The jitter draws are integer arithmetic: golden digests of 200000
 *   draws of each of six kinds (tests/adapt/trials_jitter_golden.h)
 *   match under MinGW gcc 16.1 -O0 to -Ofast -march=native
 *   -ffp-contract=fast, MSVC 19.44 /Od to /O2 /arch:AVX2 /fp:fast, WSL gcc
 *   11.4 -O2 to -Ofast -march=native and under ASan and UBSan, each with
 *   and without the compilers' 128-bit types, and in the Python binding;
 *   CI checks them on Linux, macOS arm64, MSVC and MinGW and builds
 *   tests/adapt/trials_jitter_repro.c at -O3 native and -Ofast. The
 *   fixed-point -ln(1 - u) is within 0.71 x 2^-58 of mpmath over 1000000
 *   values (tests/compare/trials_jitter_ref.py). tests/adapt/
 *   trials_test_jitter.h also checks every refusal by name; values
 *   at fixed variates and the frame ends; each distribution against its
 *   CDF (200000 draws each, the snapped exponential 1000000; worst
 *   chi-square at 0.80 of its bound) and the truncated mean; 20000 random
 *   snaps inside their intervals; the draw order against a logged
 *   generator; no draw for the pending trial; restore() and save/load
 *   (format 3) reproducing every draw and data line; per-condition
 *   columns; the rules text round trip. Measured per-frame hazard of the
 *   exponential snapped to 60 Hz, 0.5 to 2.0 s, scale 0.4: within 6.2 % of
 *   flat up to 0.8 s (truncation alone accounts for 5.2 %), within 4.4 %
 *   of the truncated geometric's exact hazard; flat per-frame hazard x 60
 *   = 2.4486/s against 1/s = 2.5/s. Fuzzed (tests/fuzz/trials_fuzz.c,
 *   jitter seeds added) under MSVC libFuzzer with ASan: 9,003,538 inputs
 *   in 1201 s, then 4,221,162 in 601 s on the integer version, no crash;
 *   the 2495 corpus files replayed on Linux under ASan and UBSan, no
 *   report. Mutations: tests/mutate/trials.toml, 47 of 47 killed (18 for
 *   jitter). Python binding 156 tests; MEX test_mex.m in MATLAB R2023a and
 *   Octave 10.1. Costs measured (Iris Xe laptop, AC, measurement lock,
 *   examples/trials_bench.c, medians, gcc 16.1 -O2 / MSVC 19.44 /O2): one
 *   ytr_jitter_draw() 66 / 54 ns uniform snapped, 82 / 109 ns
 *   exponential snapped, 32 / 62 ns exponential, 12 / 16 ns choice;
 *   next() + update() with 4 jitters mean 0.16 / 0.20 us, worst 5.2 / 4.8
 *   us. A design without jitters runs as fast as under v0.2.0 (an
 *   interleaved A/B of open(), docs/trials.md).
 *   v0.2.0 STATUS, kept as written: built and run on Windows 11 with MinGW-w64
 *   gcc 16.1 as C11, C99 and C++17 under -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow
 *   -Werror and with MSVC 19.44 under /W4 /WX, in its default C dialect and
 *   as /std:c++17; on Linux (WSL2) with gcc 11.4 as C11 and C++17 under
 *   -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all with no
 *   diagnostic; and at YTR_MAX_TRIALS 256. The extra gcc 11.4 warnings
 *   and the clang 11.1 builds of v0.1.1 (below) were not repeated for
 *   v0.2; CI's compilers give that verdict.
 *   v0.1 behavior: tests/adapt/trials_pins.h holds the hashes of 600
 *   v0.1.1 sessions (30 designs x 20 seeds: schedule, history, tallies,
 *   records, format lines, snapshot bytes); all 600 match on gcc, MSVC and
 *   Linux gcc. Both v0.1 examples print what v0.1.1 printed but the
 *   version token.
 *   v0.2 checks (tests/adapt/trials_test_v02.h): a table as the
 *   conditions, its names and texts in the data line; ORDER_LIST played as
 *   given; WITH_REPLACEMENT counts against three weight sets (worst
 *   chi-square at 0.20 of its 99.9 % bound), pairs independent (1.3 on 8
 *   df), and a variate on a running sum never drawing a zero-weight row;
 *   subsets uniform (2-subsets of 5: 13.8 on 9 df); Latin and Williams
 *   squares for n = 1..64, every row, position and adjacent pair; BLOCKED
 *   groups in Williams order for 8 participants, a RANDOM group order
 *   uniform (3.1 on 5 df), LIST, ALTERNATE cycling exactly under a repair;
 *   units: 200 seeds of followed_by with max_run, re-queues and blocks, 0
 *   broken pairs (at most 69 repair moves), 0 units split by a track, the
 *   order uniform over the 6 valid orders (7.4 on 5 df) and a free
 *   trial's slot uniform; balance: exact pair counts on 1600 orders of 8
 *   designs with and without the lead-in, uniform over all balanced orders
 *   of 3 levels (216 seen of 216, 183.0 on 215 df; without self pairs 18
 *   of 18, 19.7 on 17 df); the rules text giving the same schedule as the
 *   C calls, format_rules() pasting back, OpenSesame's lines, 14 error
 *   messages; snapshot format 2 saved and loaded at every third cut of
 *   units, groups and balance sessions, identical to the uninterrupted run;
 *   a digest of v0.2 sessions, identical on gcc (C11, C99, C++17), MSVC (C,
 *   C++17) and Linux gcc.
 *   Fuzzed: tests/fuzz/trials_fuzz.c (rules text, open, a run with
 *   re-queues, breaks, the format functions, a save and a load) under MSVC
 *   libFuzzer with ASan, 9,734,743 inputs in 1351 s, no crash; the 1383
 *   corpus files replayed on Linux under ASan and UBSan, C11 and C++17,
 *   with no report. Mutations: 29 in tests/mutate/trials.toml, all
 *   killed. Python binding: 152 tests,
 *   including the parser against Python's csv module and float(). MEX:
 *   test_mex.m passes in MATLAB R2023a and Octave 10.1.
 *   Costs measured (Iris Xe laptop, AC, measurement lock, 2026-10-07,
 *   examples/trials_bench.c, 21 rounds, medians, gcc 16.1 -O2 / MSVC
 *   19.44 /O2) for open() of a 10,000-row table: file order 0.02 / 0.02
 *   ms, FULL_RANDOM 0.04 / 0.04, CONSTRAINED max_run 3 1.82 / 1.54, units
 *   with max_run 3 5.02 / 7.03, 10,000 draws with replacement 0.73 / 1.33,
 *   a 5,000-row subset 0.14 / 0.14, balance over 8 levels 0.26 / 0.30,
 *   8 BLOCKED groups in Williams order with max_run 3 1.79 / 1.73; the
 *   worst next() + update() of 54,034 in a units session with re-queues
 *   19.0 / 2.2 us. docs/trials.md has the ranges.
 *   What is NOT done (v0.2): no run on macOS or big-endian hardware; the
 *   unit repair is measured to be biased under extra rules (docs/
 *   trials.md), less than a rule-based repair; balance is first order
 *   only and refuses tracks, groups, units and rules on its own factor.
 *   v0.1.1 STATUS, kept as written: built and run on Linux (WSL2) with
 *   gcc 11.4 as C99, C11 and C++17 under -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic
 *   -Wshadow -Werror, and under -fsanitize=address,undefined
 *   -fno-sanitize-recover=all with no diagnostic; on Windows 11 with MSVC
 *   19.44 under /W4 /WX, in its default C dialect and as /std:c++17. The
 *   header, its test and both
 *   examples also build at -O2 and -O3 under gcc 11.4 with
 *   -Warray-bounds=2 -Wstringop-overflow=4 -Wmaybe-uninitialized
 *   -Waggressive-loop-optimizations -Wnull-dereference added, and under
 *   clang 11.1 as C11, C99 and C++17, all with -Werror; the newer gcc 13,
 *   gcc 16 and clang 18 of CI were not available locally, so their verdict
 *   is CI's. Both examples print byte for
 *   byte the same on the two compilers, and the test prints the same
 *   apart from its timings.
 *   tests/adapt/trials_test.c runs at YTR_MAX_TRIALS 256 and at the
 *   default 4096 and checks: the factorial index round trip; the orders'
 *   properties over 400 seeds (SEQUENTIAL identical to PsychoPy's order,
 *   RANDOM one of each row per repetition, FULL_RANDOM exact counts and a
 *   first slot near uniform, weighted repetitions) and the Fisher-Yates
 *   draw order against a hand trace; every constraint rule on every
 *   repaired order of eight designs x 200 seeds, by a checker written
 *   separately from the header's, including block-clipped windows and
 *   runs; the failure message on impossible designs; track interleaving
 *   at rates 0.5 and 1 and 0 (rejected with conditions), round robin
 *   against a hand trace, weights, and that a finished track is never
 *   picked or asked again; practice and warmup flags, blocks and tallies;
 *   re-queues with and without a gap, and 760 random re-queues under a
 *   no-repeat rule with no unflagged violation in the realized order;
 *   ytr_mark_break() ending a run; tallies against a hand count;
 *   ytr_restore() reproducing history, schedule, tallies, records and
 *   the generator's position bit for bit, with and without tracks;
 *   ytr_save() at 42 cut points (with and without a pending trial)
 *   then ytr_load() into a garbage-filled handle and finishing,
 *   compared bit for bit with the uninterrupted run, snapshot bytes
 *   included; every load refusal; every rejected desc; YTR_ERR_FULL;
 *   the format functions against fixed strings.
 *   Compared with PsychoPy's psychopy.data.TrialHandler and TrialHandlerExt
 *   through the Python binding (tests/compare/compare_trials_psychopy.py),
 *   on the same condition lists over 100 seeds per design. The two use
 *   different generators, so random orders are compared by the properties
 *   each promises: SEQUENTIAL is identical to PsychoPy's order; under RANDOM
 *   every repetition is one block holding each condition once, on both
 *   sides; FULL_RANDOM and weighted FULL_RANDOM give exact counts per
 *   condition on both sides. The weighted SEQUENTIAL orders differ by
 *   design (PsychoPy runs a row's copies back to back, this header cycles
 *   the rows); the script reports that and does not fail on it.
 *   What is NOT done: no run on macOS or big-endian hardware, so the
 *   snapshot's portability is by construction, not by test; no loading
 *   of a snapshot written by another compiler; the constraint repair's
 *   success rate is measured only on the designs in the test, and a
 *   tight design can still need a larger desc.max_swaps. Nothing here is
 *   a timing measurement of a real session. A -DYTR_API=static build
 *   needs a translation unit that calls every function, or
 *   -Wno-unused-function.

 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A session is a sequence of trials. Each trial comes from one of two
 *   sources: a CONDITION, one row of a table the caller defines, scheduled
 *   in advance and ordered at open; or a TRACK, an adaptive procedure the
 *   caller owns, chosen at run time while it is not done. The header
 *   decides which source and which condition; the caller decides what to
 *   show. It records the outcome and a fixed-size caller record per trial,
 *   tallies outcomes per condition, and hands the history back.
 *   Practice trials run first and warmup trials open the later blocks
 *   (BLOCKS, BREAKS, ...). Every other trial, scheduled or track, is a
 *   MAIN trial; blocks and constraints count main trials only.
 *
 *   CONDITIONS
 *     Either desc.n_conditions rows with no structure (the caller knows
 *     what row 3 means), or a FACTORIAL design: desc.factors[] gives
 *     n_levels per factor and the rows are their Cartesian product, last
 *     factor fastest, so ytr_level(t, condition, factor) returns the
 *     level index of each factor. A factor's name is for the row formatter
 *     only. With factors, n_conditions is 0 or the product.
 *     YTR_MAX_FACTORS (8) factors, and the product must fit
 *     YTR_MAX_CONDITIONS (1024).
 *     desc.reps repetitions of every condition, or desc.cond_reps[] per
 *     condition (a weighted design; PsychoPy's TrialHandlerExt), which
 *     overrides reps when it is not NULL; an entry may be 0, the sum may
 *     not. The practice trials plus the scheduled trials must fit
 *     YTR_MAX_TRIALS (4096; a compile-time size of the handle), and so
 *     must the warmup trials when the session has no tracks, since their
 *     number is then known at open.
 *     open() copies cond_reps and warmup_conditions (at most
 *     YTR_MAX_CONDITIONS entries) into the handle, reading each entry
 *     once, so those two arrays may go away after open(). The other
 *     pointers (records, factor names, track contexts, rng and rng_ctx)
 *     are used after open() returns and must stay valid while the handle
 *     is in use.
 *
 *   ORDER (desc.order)
 *     YTR_ORDER_SEQUENTIAL   repetition-major, as PsychoPy does it: rep
 *                              0 of every row in row order, then rep 1, so
 *                              the rows cycle and the repetitions of one
 *                              row are spread over the session. With
 *                              cond_reps, repetition r holds the rows that
 *                              have more than r repetitions.
 *     YTR_ORDER_RANDOM       each repetition is a block; the rows are
 *                              shuffled within every block independently
 *                              (PsychoPy "random"). Every condition appears
 *                              exactly once per block (with cond_reps, once
 *                              in each block it has a repetition in). These
 *                              repetition blocks are not block_size blocks.
 *     YTR_ORDER_FULL_RANDOM  one shuffle of all reps x rows (PsychoPy
 *                              "fullRandom"). Runs of a condition are
 *                              possible.
 *     YTR_ORDER_CONSTRAINED  FULL_RANDOM followed by repair until every
 *                              constraint holds; see CONSTRAINTS (and
 *                              STRUCTURE and BALANCE for v0.2 rules).
 *     YTR_ORDER_LIST         desc.order_list as given (v0.2).
 *     YTR_ORDER_WITH_REPLACEMENT  desc.draws independent draws by
 *                              desc.weights (v0.2).
 *     ORDER LISTS, DRAWS, SUBSETS and GROUPS give the v0.2 orders.
 *     The shuffle is Fisher-Yates on the caller's generator (RANDOMNESS
 *     gives the draws). Two sessions with the same desc and the same seed
 *     get the same order, and the order is fixed at open, so
 *     ytr_condition_at(t, i) answers for a trial not yet run (a caller
 *     that preloads stimuli needs that). The schedule it indexes is the
 *     practice slots, then the main schedule; warmup trials are drawn at
 *     run time and are not in it. The answer for a slot not yet run holds
 *     unless a re-queue inserts a copy before it or the run-time check
 *     (CONSTRAINTS) moves a trial forward, which a schedule that passed the
 *     repair at open needs only after a re-queue.
 *     The rep of a scheduled trial counts the row's earlier slots in the
 *     main schedule, so under every order it numbers that row's
 *     presentations from 0; a re-queued copy keeps the rep of the trial it
 *     replaces. Practice, warmup and track trials have rep -1.
 *
 *   CONSTRAINTS (desc.constraints[], YTR_ORDER_CONSTRAINED only)
 *     Each constraint names a FACTOR (or YTR_CONDITION for the row
 *     itself), a LEVEL of it (or YTR_ANY_LEVEL: whatever level the trial
 *     at hand has), and a rule:
 *       ytr_max_run(f, l, n)          no more than n consecutive trials
 *                                       with level l of factor f
 *       ytr_max_in_window(f, l, w, n) at most n trials with level l in
 *                                       any w consecutive trials
 *       ytr_min_gap(f, l, g)          at least g other trials between two
 *                                       trials with level l
 *       ytr_no_transition(f, a, b)    level a is never directly followed
 *                                       by level b (a may equal b)
 *       ytr_first_not(f, l)           the session's first main trial
 *                                       does not have level l
 *     YTR_ANY_LEVEL is accepted by the first three. n, w and g are at
 *     least 1. YTR_MAX_CONSTRAINTS (16). A constraint under any other
 *     order is rejected at open.
 *     THE SEQUENCE. Constraints hold on the main sequence in run order.
 *     Practice and warmup trials are not in it. A track trial is, with no
 *     level of any factor: it breaks a run, widens a gap and thins a
 *     window, and never breaks a rule itself. A trial that was re-queued
 *     is in it too: the observer saw it. Unless
 *     desc.constraints_span_blocks is set, the sequence is cut into
 *     SEGMENTS at the start of every block (desc.block_size) and at every
 *     break marked with ytr_mark_break(), and every rule but first_not
 *     looks back only within the segment: a run, a gap and a transition
 *     end at the boundary, and a window that straddles it is clipped to
 *     the trials on this side, so "at most n in any w" counts fewer than w
 *     trials just after a rest. A rest between blocks ends a run as far as
 *     the observer is concerned; set constraints_span_blocks for the
 *     stricter reading, under which marked breaks do not cut either.
 *     AT OPEN. The main schedule is repaired so the rules hold on it
 *     alone, as though no track trial were interleaved. The repair is a
 *     swap search: scan the slots in order for the first whose trial
 *     breaks a rule (each rule looks back from the trial at hand), then
 *     look for a partner to swap it with, starting at a random other slot
 *     and trying up to 64 slots in turn (wrapping around, skipping trials
 *     of the same row); the first swap after which both slots obey every
 *     rule looking back is taken, and when none of the tries gives one,
 *     the swap with the random slot is taken anyway. Rescan from the lower
 *     of the two slots; at most desc.max_swaps swaps (0 = 100000). Without
 *     tracks,
 *     slot i of the main schedule is main trial i, so the segments are the
 *     blocks; with tracks the blocks' slots are not known at open and the
 *     repair counts across them, which is stricter. Adding track trials or
 *     boundaries to a sequence that obeys the rules never breaks one, so
 *     the repaired schedule holds however the run interleaves it.
 *     Without tracks, a repair that runs out of swaps FAILS open() with a
 *     message naming the first constraint still broken, its slot and the
 *     swap count, so an impossible design (two levels, max run 1, unequal
 *     counts) is found at open, not at trial 190. With tracks it does not
 *     fail: the design may rely on track trials to separate its scheduled
 *     trials, as the second USAGE example does, and the run-time check
 *     enforces that. The search is deterministic from the seed and it is
 *     not uniform over the orders that satisfy the rules; no practical
 *     method is.
 *     AT RUN TIME. Before next() hands out a scheduled trial it checks the
 *     trial against the main trials already run. If the trial would break
 *     a rule: while any track is not done, a track trial runs instead;
 *     otherwise the first later slot whose trial fits moves forward to run
 *     now, the rest keeping their order; when none fits, the trial runs
 *     anyway and its history entry carries YTR_FLAG_VIOLATION. That is
 *     the only way a session breaks a rule, and it happens only when the
 *     tracks end before the schedule does, or after a re-queue the rest of
 *     the schedule cannot absorb.
 *     v0.2 adds structural rules (STRUCTURE: UNITS) and transition balance
 *     (BALANCE), with Latin squares for counterbalancing across sessions
 *     and participants (LATIN SQUARES).
 *
 *   TABLES (desc.table; v0.2)
 *     A ysp/table.h table (a conditions file or a trial list, parsed from
 *     CSV or viewed from a pack) gives the conditions: its rows are the
 *     rows, its columns the factors, a factor's levels the column's
 *     distinct values in order of first appearance. desc.factors must then
 *     be empty and desc.n_conditions 0 or the row count, and the rows must
 *     fit YTR_MAX_CONDITIONS (open() says so and names the define). The
 *     table must outlive the handle. A rule names a column by its index
 *     (ytb_col() finds it) and a level by its number (ytb_find()); the
 *     rules text (GRAMMAR) does both by name. ytr_format_header() writes
 *     the column names and ytr_format_row() each cell's text as the file
 *     wrote it (CSV-quoted when needed); ytr_condition_from_levels()
 *     returns the first row with those levels. A fixed trial list played
 *     in file order is a table with SEQUENTIAL order and reps 1; nothing
 *     more is needed.
 *
 *   ORDER LISTS, DRAWS, SUBSETS (v0.2)
 *     YTR_ORDER_LIST plays desc.order_list (n_order_list rows, repeats
 *     allowed) as given: jsPsych's `custom` sample, a Latin-square row, a
 *     list chosen by participant. reps, cond_reps, subset, groups and
 *     constraints are refused with it; the rep of a slot counts the row's
 *     earlier slots as everywhere.
 *     YTR_ORDER_WITH_REPLACEMENT makes desc.draws independent draws, a
 *     row's chance its weight over the total (desc.weights per row, read at
 *     open; NULL for equal weights; finite, not negative, a positive sum).
 *     reps and cond_reps must be 0 / NULL, and constraints are refused: a
 *     repaired sample is not one of independent draws (fix the multiset
 *     with cond_reps and use CONSTRAINED instead).
 *     desc.subset = k keeps k of the rows that have trials, chosen
 *     uniformly, and gives the others no trials, before any order
 *     (jsPsych's without-replacement sample is subset k with FULL_RANDOM
 *     and reps 1). Under SEQUENTIAL the kept rows stay in row order. It is
 *     chosen once at open, not again per repetition. Refused with
 *     structural rules.
 *
 *   GROUPS (desc.groups; v0.2)
 *     The levels of one factor (groups.factor) as an outer order, the
 *     trials of each group ordered by desc.order inside it. A group with
 *     no trials is skipped. Group order: SEQUENTIAL (level order), RANDOM
 *     (one shuffle), LATIN or BALANCED_LATIN (row groups.participant of a
 *     square over all the factor's levels, LATIN SQUARES), or LIST
 *     (groups.list, level numbers; a group with trials missing from it is
 *     an error).
 *     BLOCKED: each group's trials run together and each group is a block:
 *     first_in_block, warmups and constraint segments follow the groups,
 *     and desc.block_size must be 0. CONSTRAINED repairs inside each group
 *     (with constraints_span_blocks the run-time check counts across groups
 *     and the repair does not). WITH_REPLACEMENT makes desc.draws draws in
 *     each group that has a row of positive weight.
 *     ALTERNATE: one trial of each group in group order, cycling (jsPsych's
 *     alternate-groups). Groups of unequal size are refused with their
 *     sizes (jsPsych cuts every group to the smallest). Under CONSTRAINED
 *     the repair swaps only trials of the same group, so the cycle holds.
 *     Groups refuse tracks (a track trial has no group; one handle per
 *     block mixes them), ORDER_LIST and balance; ALTERNATE refuses
 *     structural rules and WITH_REPLACEMENT.
 *     NESTING. Groups are the one level of nesting here: the schedule is a
 *     flat array fixed at open, which preloading (condition_at) and replay
 *     need. Deeper trees, inherited parameters, and nodes decided at run
 *     time (loop and conditional functions) belong to an experiment
 *     definition above this header.
 *
 *   STRUCTURE: UNITS (v0.2; CONSTRAINED only)
 *     Three rules shape the order instead of being repaired:
 *       ytr_followed_by(f, a, b)  every trial with level a of f is
 *                                   directly followed by one with level b
 *       ytr_preceded_by(f, b, a)  every trial with level b is directly
 *                                   preceded by one with level a
 *       ytr_chunk(f)              each run of contiguous rows with one
 *                                   value of f (not "" in a table) is one
 *                                   unit, in row order, every repetition
 *     followed_by pairs each a-trial with a distinct b-trial chosen by a
 *     shuffle (spare b-trials are free; fewer b- than a-trials is an
 *     error); preceded_by the same the other way; with equal counts either
 *     is a prime-target pair. A chunk's rows must have equal repetitions,
 *     and one value in two separate runs is reported as a typo. The rows
 *     that two structural rules touch must not overlap (a longer unit is a
 *     chunk column). The UNITS are shuffled as wholes: with no other rule
 *     the order is uniform over all orders that keep the units, and the
 *     rules cannot be broken. Other rules are checked on the trials and
 *     repaired by moving whole units: the first of up to 64 unit
 *     boundaries, from a random start, where the unit's trials and the slot
 *     that closes the gap obey every rule looking back; else the drawn
 *     boundary. Moves, not swaps: a swap cannot change a sequence whose
 *     one-trial units are all alike (measured, docs/trials.md). This
 *     repair counts runs across block boundaries, since a boundary that
 *     falls inside a unit moves to its end.
 *     AT RUN TIME the trials of a unit run back to back: no track trial,
 *     no draw, no forward move and no block start inside a unit (a
 *     block_size boundary waits for the unit's end, and the blocks after it
 *     keep the block_size grid). A scheduled trial inside a unit that
 *     breaks a rule runs, flagged YTR_FLAG_VIOLATION. The forward move
 *     moves the first later unit all of whose trials fit. A re-queue of any
 *     trial of a unit queues a copy of the whole unit at a unit boundary.
 *     Units are allowed with tracks and with BLOCKED groups (a unit's rows
 *     must then share the group).
 *
 *   BALANCE (v0.2; CONSTRAINED only)
 *     ytr_balance(f): in the main sequence every ordered pair of levels of
 *     f (that have trials) is adjacent equally often, lambda times, a level
 *     followed by itself included; ytr_balance_no_repeat(f) leaves the
 *     self pairs out (no level twice in a row). Every level must have the
 *     same number of trials, n x lambda (n - 1 times lambda without self
 *     pairs) for n levels; open() names the counts that would fit. The
 *     order is drawn uniformly from all such orders: an Euler circuit of
 *     the complete directed graph on the levels, each arc lambda times, by
 *     Kandel, Matias, Unger and Winkler (1996) as Brooks (2012) recommends;
 *     then each level's trials are shuffled into its places. The sequence
 *     starts with a LEAD-IN, one more trial of the start level, so all
 *     n^2 lambda transitions occur (Brooks: "each sequence contains an extra
 *     trial of one condition"). The lead-in is a main trial (the observer
 *     sees it; the rules count it) flagged YTR_FLAG_LEADIN, with rep -1,
 *     left out of the tallies, shown in a `leadin` column of the data lines,
 *     and it cannot be re-queued. ytr_balance_flags(f,
 *     YTR_BALANCE_NO_LEADIN) leaves it out, for a short sequence that
 *     cannot afford the trial: one transition, last to first, is then
 *     missing. Other rules on other factors are repaired by swaps between
 *     trials of the same level of f, which keep every transition; a rule on
 *     f itself (or any rule when f is YTR_CONDITION) is refused, because
 *     no exact sampler has both properties and rejection fails as orders
 *     grow (docs/trials.md has the numbers). Balance refuses tracks
 *     (track trials cut transitions), groups and structural rules. It
 *     counts transitions across block boundaries. A re-queue adds
 *     transitions; the realized order is then not exactly balanced, and the
 *     history shows the re-queued trial.
 *
 *   LATIN SQUARES (ytr_latin; v0.2)
 *     ytr_latin(n, row, balanced, out) fills out[n] with row `row` of an
 *     n x n square and returns the number of rows of the design. Cyclic:
 *     out[j] = (row + j) mod n, n rows, every item once in every position
 *     over the rows. Balanced (Williams 1949): first row 0, 1, n-1, 2, n-2,
 *     3, ...; row r adds r mod n to each entry; for even n the n rows have
 *     every ordered pair adjacent exactly once; for odd n the design has 2n
 *     rows, rows n..2n-1 the reverses of rows 0..n-1, and every ordered
 *     pair adjacent exactly twice. row is taken modulo the rows, so a
 *     participant number goes in directly. Uses: an order list for one
 *     sequence of conditions per participant; a group order (LATIN,
 *     BALANCED_LATIN) for counterbalanced blocks; session k of participant p
 *     runs item out[k] of row p.
 *
 *   GRAMMAR (ytr_rules; v0.2)
 *     Rules text sets the order and constraint fields of a desc, a
 *     statement per line, one statement per C call or desc field, columns
 *     and levels by name. ytr_format_rules() writes a session's settings
 *     the same way, so a logged session pastes back in.
 *       # a comment                      blank lines and comments anywhere
 *       order constrained
 *       reps 10
 *       where list=@participant          keep the rows of one list
 *       max_run target 3                 any level of target
 *       max_in_window target=catch 6 1   level by its text (or value)
 *       followed_by cue valid probe
 *     A line is words separated by blanks; `#` outside quotes starts a
 *     comment; a token may be quoted ("new york", "" for a quote). A
 *     SELECTOR is COLUMN (any level) or COLUMN=VALUE; @row is the row itself
 *     (YTR_CONDITION), with row numbers as values; @participant as a value
 *     is level number (participant mod the level count). A value is the
 *     level's text for a STRING column, compared by value for a numeric one
 *     ("0.50" finds 0.5), and a level number for a factor with no table.
 *     A count is decimal digits. Statements and what they set:

 *     name and values) are carved from rules_desc.arena (at most 4 x
 *     YTR_MAX_TRIALS + 32 bytes per row + 300 bytes per jitter; a short
 *     arena is an error naming the bytes needed). open() and
 *     load() copy or read them, so the arena may go away after open().
 *
 *   JITTER (desc.jitters[], desc.n_jitters; v0.2.1)
 *     A jitter is a duration drawn for every trial: a foreperiod, an
 *     inter-trial interval, an SOA. The header draws and logs it; the
 *     caller waits it. The drawn duration is a whole number of
 *     nanoseconds, .ns (int64), for a clock; .s is the same duration in
 *     seconds, the correctly rounded .ns / 1e9; .frames is the whole frame
 *     count when the jitter snaps, else -1. lo, hi, s and the values are
 *     given in seconds and taken to the nearest nanosecond.
 *       ytr_uniform(name, lo, hi)          uniform over the nanoseconds
 *                                            of [lo, hi]
 *       ytr_choice(name, values, n)        one of n values (at most
 *                                            YTR_MAX_JITTER_VALUES, 32),
 *                                            each 1/n likely; repeat a value
 *                                            to weight it
 *       ytr_exponential(name, lo, hi, s)   lo + an exponential of mean s,
 *                                            truncated to [lo, hi)
 *       ytr_frames(j, num, den)            j snapped to whole frames of
 *                                            num/den Hz (ysp/timeline.h's
 *                                            rates; den 0 means 1)
 *     0 <= lo <= hi <= YTR_JITTER_MAX_S (1e6 s), 1 ns <= s <= 1e6 s,
 *     values in [0, 1e6] s. The name heads the jitter's data-line column:
 *     1 to 31 of [A-Za-z0-9_], not starting with a digit, unique in the
 *     session.
 *     THE NON-AGING FOREPERIOD. An exponential has a constant hazard: the
 *     chance that the target comes in the next instant, given that it has
 *     not come yet, is 1/s whatever the time already waited, so waiting
 *     tells the observer nothing and expectancy stays flat. TRUNCATION at
 *     hi bends that: the density is e^-(t-lo)/s / (s (1 - e^-(hi-lo)/s)) on
 *     [lo, hi], the hazard at t is (1/s) / (1 - e^-(hi-t)/s), so it is
 *     within e^-3 = 5 % of flat until 3 s before hi and grows without
 *     bound at hi, and the mean is lo + s - (hi-lo) e^-(hi-lo)/s /
 *     (1 - e^-(hi-lo)/s). The draws the truncation removes, e^-(hi-lo)/s
 *     of the untruncated ones (2.4 % for lo 0.5, hi 2.0, s 0.4), are
 *     spread over [lo, hi) in proportion to the density, not piled at hi
 *     (THE DRAW). Choose hi - lo of 3 to 4 s or more.
 *     FRAMES. A snapped jitter is a whole number of frames k, its
 *     duration k den / num s, which .ns rounds to the nearest nanosecond
 *     (ties up). The frames inside [lo, hi] are those whose .ns lies in
 *     [lo, hi], all in integers, so 0.07 s at 100 Hz is frame 7 though 0.07
 *     x 100 is 7.000000000000001 in binary. UNIFORM: each of those frames
 *     equally likely. CHOICE: each value moved to its nearest frame (ties
 *     up). EXPONENTIAL: a geometric over those frames, P(k) proportional
 *     to q^(k - first),
 *     q = e^-(den / (num s)): the per-frame hazard is exactly
 *     1 - q, the chance an exponential of mean s ends within one frame,
 *     until the truncation term 1 / (1 - q^(frames left)) takes over as
 *     above. As a rate per second it is (1 - q) num/den, slightly below
 *     1/s: 2.4486/s against 2.5/s at 60 Hz with s = 0.4 (2.1 % low). The
 *     test measures it (STATUS). When no whole frame lies in [lo, hi],
 *     open() and ytr_jitter_check() refuse and name the rate and the
 *     interval.
 *     PER CONDITION. With desc.table, lo_column, hi_column and (for
 *     EXPONENTIAL) scale_column name numeric columns whose cells replace
 *     lo, hi and s for a trial of that row; open() checks every row and
 *     names the first bad one. A track trial has no row and uses the
 *     jitter's own numbers, which open() then checks too.
 *     THE DRAW. Each jitter takes one raw draw u per new trial
 *     (RANDOMNESS gives the order), so the generator's position after a
 *     trial does not depend on the values drawn, and maps u53 = floor(u
 *     2^53) (u clamped to [0, 1)) in integer arithmetic only: no libm call
 *     and no floating-point operation that a C library, a compiler or a
 *     flag (-Ofast, /fp:fast, FMA contraction) could round differently, so
 *     a draw is the same nanosecond on every platform, and a session
 *     replays exactly in another build (the Python binding regenerates a
 *     Windows session). UNIFORM: lo + floor(u53 (hi - lo + 1) / 2^53) ns.
 *     CHOICE: value floor(u53 n / 2^53). EXPONENTIAL: E = s (-ln(1 - u)),
 *     the inverse CDF of the untruncated exponential, in nanoseconds
 *     rounded half up, then lo + (E mod (hi - lo)): the exponential is
 *     memoryless, so E folded into the interval is exactly the truncated
 *     exponential, with no exp() needed (hi - lo = 0 gives lo). Snapped,
 *     the same with E counted in whole frames, G = floor(-ln(1 - u) x the
 *     scale in frames, s num / (den 1e9) held to 62 bits), folded into the
 *     frames inside. -ln(1 - u) is a Q58 fixed-point logarithm (a 128-entry
 *     table of reciprocals and their logarithms, from mpmath, and a
 *     degree-8 integer series): within 2^-57 of the exact value by
 *     analysis, 0.71 x 2^-58 at worst over 1,000,000 values checked against
 *     mpmath (tests/compare/trials_jitter_ref.py), so E is within 0.5 ns +
 *     s x 7e-18 of s (-ln(1 - u)) for the u53 drawn.
 *     ytr_jitter(t, i, j) returns trial i's draw any time after next()
 *     handed trial i out; ytr_jitter_index() finds j by name. The data
 *     line (ytr_format_row) ends with one column per jitter, named by
 *     the jitter, the seconds as the exact decimal of .ns
 *     (1.184516667); ytr_format_meta() and ytr_format_rules() write
 *     the jitters' settings.
 *     CALL LEVEL. ytr_jitter_draw(&j, rng, ctx) calls rng once and maps
 *     the variate; ytr_jitter_map(&j, u) maps a variate the caller has;
 *     ytr_jitter_check() says why a desc is refused (columns need a
 *     session). They touch no session: a draw made with the session's
 *     generator between next() and update() moves every later draw, and
 *     restore() would not repeat it. Use desc.jitters (replayed and
 *     logged), or a generator of the caller's own that the caller logs.
 *
 *   TRACKS (desc.tracks[], desc.n_tracks, desc.interleave, desc.track_rate)
 *     A track is {ctx, is_done(ctx), weight}. While a track is not done and
 *     a scheduled trial is left, next() runs a track trial with
 *     probability desc.track_rate and otherwise the next scheduled trial.
 *     track_rate defaults to 1 with no conditions and to 0 with no tracks;
 *     with both it is required, in (0, 1], and 1 runs the tracks to their
 *     end before the schedule. When the schedule is exhausted the tracks
 *     run alone; when every track is done the schedule runs alone. A
 *     scheduled trial that would break a constraint gives way to a track
 *     trial, with no draw (CONSTRAINTS). Among tracks:
 *     YTR_INTERLEAVE_RANDOM draws by weight among those not done (weight
 *     0 means 1), YTR_INTERLEAVE_ROUND_ROBIN cycles through them in index
 *     order, skipping any that are done. Once is_done() has returned true
 *     for a track it is never called on it or picked again. next() calls
 *     is_done() once on each track not yet done each time it chooses a
 *     main or warmup trial, never more than once per track per call, and
 *     not when it hands out a practice trial or returns the pending trial
 *     again; ytr_done() calls it too. The header never calls anything
 *     else on a track: the caller asks its own handle for the level, as
 *     the USAGE example shows. YTR_MAX_TRACKS (16).
 *
 *   BLOCKS, BREAKS, PRACTICE, WARMUP, CATCH TRIALS, RE-QUEUES
 *     desc.block_size splits the main sequence into blocks of that many
 *     main trials (0 = one block); a trial later re-queued counts, since
 *     the observer spent the time. Practice trials are block -1 and the
 *     main trials blocks 0, 1, ...; ytr_trial_info.block and
 *     .first_in_block tell the caller where a rest screen goes.
 *     first_in_block is set on the first practice trial, on the first main
 *     trial, and on the first trial of every later block, which is its
 *     first warmup trial when there are warmups; that trial also has
 *     after_break. The header has no clock: a break by elapsed time is the
 *     caller's check between trials, and ytr_mark_break(t) records that
 *     one happened. Called between trials it flags the next trial handed
 *     out; called with a trial pending it flags that one; either way a
 *     constraint segment starts at the next main trial (the pending one,
 *     when that is a main trial). It does not start a block or run warmup
 *     trials, and it changes nothing in the order: a boundary only relaxes
 *     a rule the schedule already meets. So a break taken on the caller's
 *     own schedule leaves the same flag in the history as a scheduled one.
 *     desc.n_practice trials run before the schedule, drawn at open at
 *     random from desc.warmup_conditions[] (any condition when that list is
 *     empty), or cycled through that list in order under SEQUENTIAL;
 *     flagged practice, excluded from the tallies and the constraints.
 *     desc.n_warmup trials run at the start of every block after the
 *     first, when a main trial is left to follow them, drawn at run time
 *     the same way (under SEQUENTIAL the cycle restarts in each block) and
 *     flagged warmup: a reintroduction after a rest. n_warmup needs
 *     block_size. Both are condition trials, never track trials: the
 *     header does not know what an easy level is, so a warmup for a
 *     staircase is the caller's, which sees the flag, shows what it likes,
 *     and decides whether the track hears about it.
 *     A catch trial is a condition like any other, placed by the
 *     constraints; the second USAGE example is that.
 *     ytr_requeue(t), called INSTEAD of ytr_update() for a scheduled
 *     trial (not a practice, warmup or track trial: YTR_ERR_ARG), records
 *     YTR_REQUEUE as its outcome and inserts a copy (same row, same rep,
 *     flagged requeued) into the schedule: at the end when
 *     desc.requeue_gap is 0; otherwise at a random slot with at least
 *     requeue_gap scheduled trials before it, or at the end when fewer are
 *     left. For a missed response or a fixation break. The copy is tallied
 *     when it runs. When the history could not hold it (trials handed out
 *     + slots left + 1 > YTR_MAX_TRIALS) nothing is inserted, the trial
 *     is recorded as YTR_INVALID, and requeue returns YTR_ERR_FULL. The
 *     copy is placed without a constraint check; the run-time check keeps
 *     the realized order within the rules where it can.
 *
 *   THE LOOP
 *     ytr_next(t, &info)        the next trial: its index, or YTR_DONE
 *     ytr_update(t, outcome, rec) what happened, plus the caller's record
 *     ytr_done(t)               nothing pending or scheduled, tracks done
 *     ytr_requeue(t)            do this one again later
 *   next() without an update() in between returns the same trial again
 *   (info may be NULL); update() or requeue() without a pending trial is
 *   YTR_ERR_ORDER. `outcome` is any int >= 0 the caller chooses (1 =
 *   correct, a key code, a category), or YTR_INVALID (-1) for a trial
 *   that produced no usable response, excluded from the tallies. Lower
 *   values are YTR_ERR_ARG: YTR_REQUEUE (-2) is what requeue()
 *   records. `rec` copies desc.record_size bytes into the trial's slot of
 *   desc.records; NULL zero-fills the slot; with no records buffer (or
 *   record_size 0) it is ignored.
 *
 *   TALLIES AND HISTORY
 *     ytr_count(t, c, outcome) and ytr_proportion(t, c, outcome) over
 *     the completed, valid (outcome >= 0), non-practice, non-warmup trials
 *     of condition c; ytr_n_valid(t, c) is how many. count() also
 *     counts the YTR_INVALID or YTR_REQUEUE trials of c when asked;
 *     proportion() is NaN for those and when n_valid is 0. That is the
 *     method-of-constant-stimuli estimate; a psychometric fit is an
 *     offline job on the history, as everywhere in this collection.
 *     ytr_history(t, &n) is the trial array, a pending trial included
 *     (without YTR_FLAG_DONE, outcome YTR_INVALID); ytr_record(t, i)
 *     the caller's bytes for trial i. ytr_format_row(t, i, buf, cap)
 *     writes one newline-terminated CSV line:
 *       index,block,rep,condition,track,practice,warmup,requeued,
 *       after_break,outcome
 *     then one column per factor level (empty for a track trial); the
 *     outcome is empty while the trial is pending. ytr_format_header()
 *     writes the matching header, with the factor names (factor<i> when a
 *     name is NULL, quoted when it holds a comma, a quote or a line break).
 *     No file is touched.
 *
 *   SAVING, REPLAY AND RESUME
 *     The header's own state is small and scalar: the desc's numbers, the
 *     schedule, the history (outcomes and flags), the tallies. Three ways
 *     out, none of them a file:
 *       ytr_format_header / ytr_format_row   CSV lines for analysis
 *       ytr_format_meta                        one line of the desc's
 *                                                numbers and the counts, as
 *                                                key=value pairs, to head a
 *                                                data file
 *       ytr_save / ytr_load                  a versioned byte snapshot
 *                                                of the whole state, for
 *                                                resuming after a crash
 *     ytr_save() writes ytr_save_size(t) bytes; ytr_load() rebuilds a
 *     handle from them plus a desc that re-supplies what a snapshot cannot
 *     carry (the pointers: rng and its state, records, cond_reps, the
 *     warmup list, factor names, tracks), checks that the desc's numbers
 *     match the saved ones, and continues at the pending trial when one
 *     was pending. The generator's state is the caller's: save it beside
 *     the snapshot (for ytr_splitmix, the uint64_t) and put it back
 *     before the next draw. ytr_load() draws nothing and calls no track.
 *     SNAPSHOT LAYOUT, format 1. Every integer is little-endian two's

 *     without a table), i32 conditions, i32 factors, i32 n_order_list, i32
 *     draws, i32 subset, i32 groups.mode, groups.factor, groups.order,
 *     groups.participant, groups.n_list, u64 hash of the order list,
 *     weights and group list (which the handle does not keep), and at the
 *     end of the state section i32 blk, i32 blk_next, u8 units, u8
 *     has_leadin. schedule_flags then also carry the unit, block-start and
 *     lead-in marks of each slot.
 *     SNAPSHOT LAYOUT, format 3 (v0.2.1), for a desc with jitters: format
 *     2 (its desc and state sections whether or not a v0.2 field is used)
 *     with, at the end of the desc section, i32 n_jitters and per jitter u8
 *     name length and the name's bytes, i32 dist, f64 lo, hi, scale, i32
 *     n_values and f64 per value, i32 rate_num, rate_den, i32 lo, hi and
 *     scale column (-1 for none); and after the records, n_run x n_jitters
 *     i64 draws in trial order (nanoseconds, or the frame count of a
 *     snapped jitter).
 *     ytr_load() compares the desc section with the desc it is given and
 *     names the first field that differs, then range-checks every number
 *     it reads, so a wrong, truncated or corrupt snapshot fails the load
 *     with a message instead of indexing outside the handle. When
 *     record_size > 0 the records are copied into desc.records.
 *     Replay is the other route: the order is a function of desc and the
 *     generator's state at open, and every run-time draw consumes the
 *     generator in a fixed order, so ytr_restore(t, outcomes, records,
 *     n) after a fresh open() with the same desc and seed rebuilds the
 *     same run: for each trial it calls next(), then requeue() when the
 *     outcome is YTR_REQUEUE and update() otherwise, so the outcomes in
 *     ytr_history() feed it directly. Two limits: a break marked with
 *     ytr_mark_break() is not in the outcomes (drive the loop by hand
 *     and mark it again, or use a snapshot); and next() asks the tracks
 *     is_done(), so with tracks each must answer at every trial as it did
 *     in the original run, which a track restored to its final state does
 *     not. For a session with tracks, drive the loop by hand, feeding each
 *     track its own recorded trial, or use a snapshot. Track state is the
 *     caller's either way; the method headers replay from their own
 *     histories.
 *     The caller's per-trial data is deliberately NOT the header's
 *     problem beyond desc.record_size bytes per trial. Large or variable
 *     data (an eye trace, an EEG epoch, audio) belongs in its own
 *     container under the trial index, and the fixed record holds a
 *     reference to it if one is needed. The sequencer's table stays narrow
 *     and joins on trial index.
 *
 *   RANDOMNESS
 *     desc.rng(ctx) returns a uniform variate in [0, 1). Required for every
 *     order but SEQUENTIAL, for random interleaving of more than one
 *     track, for a track_rate below 1 with both conditions and tracks, for
 *     practice and warmup draws except under SEQUENTIAL, and for a
 *     requeue_gap; open() says which if it is missing. The header owns no
 *     generator and seeds nothing. ytr_splitmix() is a documented
 *     convenience: a splitmix64 step on a uint64_t the CALLER owns, so
 *     `d.rng = ytr_splitmix; d.rng_ctx = &seed;` is the whole setup and
 *     the seed is the caller's to log.
 *     DRAW ORDER. This is a contract: replay and resume depend on it. An
 *     "index draw below m" is floor(u * m) clamped to [0, m - 1], so a
 *     variate outside [0, 1) is clamped, not rejected. A "raw draw" is u
 *     itself.
 *     In ytr_open(), in this order:
 *       1. practice: one index draw per practice trial, in trial order,
 *          below the warmup list's length (or n_conditions). None under
 *          SEQUENTIAL.
 *       2. order: the main schedule starts in SEQUENTIAL order. RANDOM
 *          shuffles each repetition block in turn; FULL_RANDOM and
 *          CONSTRAINED shuffle the whole main schedule once. A shuffle of
 *          m items is Fisher-Yates from the top: for i = m-1 down to 1,
 *          j = an index draw below i + 1, swap items i and j (m - 1
 *          draws).
 *       3. repair (CONSTRAINED): one index draw per swap, s below n - 1
 *          for a main schedule of n slots; the partner search for the
 *          trial in slot k starts at slot (k + 1 + s) mod n.
 *     In ytr_next(), when it chooses a new trial:
 *       4. a practice trial: nothing.
 *       5. a warmup trial: one index draw into the list. None under
 *          SEQUENTIAL.
 *       6. a main trial: when a scheduled trial and a live track are both
 *          available, the scheduled trial breaks no rule, and track_rate
 *          is below 1: one raw draw u, a track trial when u < track_rate.
 *          Then, for a track trial under RANDOM interleave with more than
 *          one live track: one raw draw u, and the track is the first, in
 *          index order, whose running sum of live weights exceeds u times
 *          the live weights' total.
 *     In ytr_requeue() with requeue_gap > 0:
 *       7. one index draw for the slot, even when fewer than requeue_gap
 *          slots are left and the copy goes at the end.
 *     v0.2. A desc with none of the v0.2 fields draws exactly as above. In
 *     open(), after step 1 and in place of steps 2 and 3:
 *       subset: an index draw below m - i for i = 0..k-1, a partial
 *          Fisher-Yates over the m rows that have trials, in row order.
 *       groups RANDOM: one shuffle of the group levels that have trials,
 *          in level order.
 *       per part (the whole main schedule, or each BLOCKED group in run
 *          order, or each ALTERNATE group in level order):
 *          SEQUENTIAL nothing; RANDOM a shuffle per repetition block;
 *          FULL_RANDOM one shuffle; WITH_REPLACEMENT one raw draw u per
 *          trial, the row the first in row order whose running sum of
 *          weights exceeds u times the total; CONSTRAINED with structural
 *          rules: per rule in constraint order, one shuffle of the partner
 *          trials (followed_by: the second level's; preceded_by: the
 *          first level's), then one shuffle of the units; CONSTRAINED
 *          without: one shuffle. Then the repair: one index draw per swap
 *          (below the part's length minus 1) or per unit move (below the
 *          number of units minus 1).
 *       balance: the start level (an index draw below the level count),
 *          the backward walk (an index draw below the number of
 *          predecessors per step until every level is seen), each level's
 *          arc order in level order (a shuffle of its arcs but the tree
 *          arc), each level's trials in level order (a shuffle), the
 *          lead-in's trial (an index draw below the level's trial count);
 *          then the repair if there are other rules.
 *     In ytr_next(): nothing inside a unit. In ytr_requeue() with units,
 *     groups or a lead-in and requeue_gap > 0: one index draw among the
 *     unit boundaries from the gap (and the unit's end) to the end of the
 *     schedule, or of the BLOCKED group's block.
 *     v0.2.1. A desc with no jitters draws exactly as above. With jitters,
 *     every new trial that next() hands out (practice, warmup, main,
 *     track, a re-queued copy, a lead-in) takes, after all of the draws
 *     above for it, one raw draw per jitter in jitter order. open() draws
 *     none, so the schedule is the one without jitters; next() returning
 *     the pending trial again draws none.
 *     Nothing else draws: not update(), mark_break(), load(), done(), the
 *     format functions or the tallies.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   RETURN VALUES AND ERRORS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ytr_open() and ytr_load() return bool and fill ytr_error().
 *   Everything else returns a value or a code and never touches the
 *   message. ytr_next() returns the trial index (>= 0) or YTR_DONE
 *   (-1) or an error below -1; ytr_strerror() names a code.
 *
 *     YTR_ERR_ARG     null handle, condition or factor or trial out of
 *                       range, an outcome below YTR_INVALID, a requeue of
 *                       a practice, warmup or track trial, a restore with
 *                       more outcomes than the session has trials, a save
 *                       buffer smaller than ytr_save_size()
 *     YTR_ERR_CLOSED  the handle is not open
 *     YTR_ERR_ORDER   update() or requeue() with no pending trial (next()
 *                       twice is fine), restore() on a handle that has
 *                       already handed out a trial
 *     YTR_ERR_FULL    next() with YTR_MAX_TRIALS trials in the history
 *                       and something left to run; a re-queue that will not
 *                       fit (refused, the outcome recorded as YTR_INVALID)
 *
 *   On a closed or null handle the counts (n_conditions, n_factors,
 *   n_scheduled, n_run, n_done, n_valid) are 0, the lookups (level,
 *   condition_at, condition_from_levels, count) and the loop functions
 *   return the error, proportion is NaN, history and record are NULL,
 *   done and is_open are false, and save_size is 0.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The handle holds the condition table, the schedule and the history
 *   inline: 19 bytes per trial at YTR_MAX_TRIALS (4096) plus 12 per
 *   condition at YTR_MAX_CONDITIONS (1024) plus the desc, 91480
 *   bytes on a 64-bit ABI in v0.1; v0.2 adds scratch for open() and the
 *   unit moves (2 x 2 bytes per trial), the group order (2 bytes per
 *   condition) and the table's level pointers: 110528 bytes; v0.2.1 adds
 *   8 bytes per trial per YTR_MAX_JITTERS (4) for the draws and 1.7 KB
 *   for the jitters' settings: 243344 bytes (YTR_MAX_JITTERS 1: 143744).
 *   Nothing allocates. The caller's per-trial
 *   records live in desc.records, a buffer of at least record_size x
 *   YTR_MAX_TRIALS bytes the caller provides. Define YTR_MAX_TRIALS or
 *   YTR_MAX_CONDITIONS before the include to resize; both must stay
 *   below 32768, since trial and condition numbers are stored in 16 bits.
 *   A handle is not thread-safe; one thread runs one session.
 *   Costs: open() is O(trials) plus, per repair swap, up to 128 slot
 *   checks for the partner and a rescan from the lower slot, each check
 *   O(constraints x rule span), so an impossible
 *   design spends the whole swap budget (tests/adapt/trials_test.c
 *   prints what that costs: 60 ms for a 4000-trial impossible design at
 *   the default budget, gcc -O2 on a desktop x64). v0.2: a table, an order
 *   list, a subset and draws are O(trials) at open (draws O(trials x log
 *   rows)); units shuffle in O(units) and repair by moves of O(slots)
 *   each; balance is O(levels^2 x lambda) for the circuit plus a shuffle;
 *   groups repair inside each group. STATUS has measured times. next()
 *   is O(tracks + constraints x rule span), plus O(slots left x
 *   constraints x rule span) when a scheduled trial has to be moved
 *   forward. update() is O(1) plus the record copy;
 *   requeue() is O(slots left); count() for an outcome other than 1 is
 *   O(trials). "Rule span" is n for max_run, w for max_in_window, g for
 *   min_gap and 1 for the rest.

 *   YTR_API (and YTB_API for ysp/table.h) to override the default `extern`
 *   linkage (definitions too, so static works; a -DYTR_API=static build
 *   needs a translation unit that calls every function, or
 *   -Wno-unused-function).
