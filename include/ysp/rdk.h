/* ysp/rdk.h - v0.1.0 - public domain single-header random dot kinematograms
 *
 *   The motion of a random dot kinematogram (RDK) on the CPU: coherence,
 *   direction, speed, density, dot lifetime, the noise rule and the signal
 *   rule, each by a named published algorithm; a circular or rectangular
 *   aperture with an edge rule that keeps the density uniform; motion by
 *   the predicted onset of each frame, so a dropped frame moves dots by the
 *   time that passed; interleaved sets (Movshon/Newsome); and a
 *   reproducible sequence: the state is integers and every random draw is
 *   a counter-based function of (seed, stream, dot, update, slot), so a
 *   trial regenerates bit for bit on any platform from what MODEL lists.
 *   Output goes into caller arrays: x, y pairs as ysp/gfx.h's DOTS read
 *   them, or strided into ysp/gfx.h's instance records (a gabor array whose
 *   elements ride the dots).
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no OS calls, no threads, no I/O, one allocation at open
 *   (none when the caller gives the memory). Needs nothing but the C
 *   standard library (<math.h> for frexp, sqrt and llround). It does not
 *   include ysp/gfx.h or ysp/timeline.h. C99 is the floor: it builds as
 *   C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.1.0 - first version.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.1.0. See docs/rdk.md for the tables.
 *   Built with MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX: the default C dialect, C11, C++17),
 *   MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 (C99, C11, C++17) and gcc 11.4 on WSL2 (C99, C11,
 *   C++17; the test under ASan and UBSan, at -O3 -march=native and at
 *   -Ofast -march=native). tests/adapt/rdk_test.c checks statistics,
 *   not pixels: the realized coherence counted from the dots'
 *   displacements (EXACT: round(c n) on every update; BERNOULLI: the
 *   binomial mean and variance), density against uniform by chi-square in
 *   equal-area cells and in the band along the edge for 36 configurations
 *   (0.42 to 0.79 of the p = 1e-7 critical value; REPLOT 18.6 to 21.2
 *   times it), lifetimes (exact under the frame clock, the mean within
 *   1.4e-5 under the onset clock, no pulse), the displacement of signal
 *   dots against speed x elapsed time under jittered and dropped onsets
 *   (4.7e-7 units on a 5-unit radius, the float output's resolution), the
 *   noise rules' direction and position distributions, frozen noise
 *   across coherence levels, dropped frames under both clocks, interleaved
 *   sets, LEAST_RECENT's rule, the edge invariant under stalls of up to
 *   1000 s; and the exact pieces: Philox against Random123's known
 *   answers, the angle conversion against exact rationals, sincos within
 *   2.6e-9 of libm, and 8 golden digests that tests/compare/rdk_ref.py, an
 *   independent Python model written from REPRODUCIBILITY, reproduces.
 *   26 of 26 non-equivalent mutations of the header caught (one by the
 *   digests only), 2 equivalent (tests/mutate/rdk.toml).
 *   Cost on the Iris Xe laptop (AC, the lock held; examples/rdk/bench.c,
 *   MSVC 19.44 and gcc 16.1; docs/rdk.md has the tables):
 *   yrdk_update() for 1000 dots 8.9 to 16 us (SAME with DIRECTION
 *   noise, which draws nothing) and 18 to 43 us (the rules that draw for
 *   every dot), for 10,000 dots 102 to 172 us and 183 to 443 us. The bars
 *   set in the design, 10 and 100 us, are missed by every rule that draws
 *   and, at 10,000 dots, by every rule. With ysp/gfx.h
 *   (examples/rdk/gfx_rdk_bench.c, 1920 x 1200): 10,000 dots updated and
 *   drawn in 0.30 ms of CPU and 0.32 to 0.38 ms of GPU over the empty
 *   frame; 10,000 gabors riding the dots 0.41 ms of CPU and 1.36 to 1.48
 *   ms of GPU. No number is a measurement of light.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   USAGE
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Do this:
 *
 *       #define YSP_RDK_IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 *   in *one* C or C++ file before including this header. Every other file
 *   just includes it.
 *
 *   A classic RDK drawn with ysp/gfx.h (examples/rdk/gfx_rdk.c runs it):
 *
 *       static yrdk_field rdk;
 *       if (yrdk_open(&rdk, &(yrdk_desc){ .w = 400, .count = 200,
 *               .coherence = 0.25f, .direction = 0, .speed = 120 }) < 0)
 *           fail(yrdk_error(&rdk));
 *       ygfx_buf buf = ygfx_buffer(&gfx, (size_t)rdk.n * 8);
 *       ygfx_stim dots = ygfx_dots(&(ygfx_dots_desc){ .buf = buf,
 *           .count = (uint32_t)rdk.n, .dot_size = 4,
 *           .aperture = YGFX_CIRCLE, .w = 400, .color = { 1, 1, 1 } });
 *       static float xy[2 * 200];
 *
 *       yscr_frame f;
 *       yscr_begin(&scr, &f);
 *       yrdk_start(&rdk, trial_seed, f.onset);       // the trial's first frame
 *       do {
 *           yrdk_update(&rdk, f.onset);              // dots at this frame's onset
 *           yrdk_xy(&rdk, xy);
 *           ygfx_buffer_update(&gfx, buf, 0, xy, (size_t)rdk.n * 8);
 *           ygfx_begin(&gfx, &f);
 *           ygfx_draw(&gfx, &dots);
 *           ygfx_end(&gfx);
 *           yscr_flip(&scr);
 *       } while (yscr_begin(&scr, &f) == YSCR_OK);
 *
 *   coherence, direction and speed are plain floats of the field, read at
 *   each update, so a ysp/timeline.h channel drives them through
 *   ygfx_bind.field, as a GSAP timeline drives a property:
 *
 *       static const ygfx_bind binds[] = {
 *           { .stim = &dots, .param = YGFX_P_VISIBLE, .channel = DOTS_ON },
 *           { .field = &rdk.coherence, .channel = COH },
 *           { .field = &rdk.direction, .channel = DIR },
 *       };
 *       ytl_seq q = ytl_seq_on(&tl, TRIAL);        // the trial, in order
 *       ytl_set_value(&q, COH, 0.256f);
 *       ytl_on(&q, DOTS_ON);
 *       ytl_wait(&q, YTL_MS(700));                 // DIR is a track: a tween
 *       ytl_then(&q, DIR, &(ytl_tween_desc){ .from = 0, .from_set = true,
 *                                                 .to = 90, .duration = YTL_MS(300) });
 *       ytl_off(&q, DOTS_ON);
 *       ...
 *       ytl_evaluate(&tl, &(ytl_frame){ f.onset, f.period, f.index }, fired, 8);
 *       ygfx_apply(binds, 3, ytl_values(&tl));
 *       yrdk_update(&rdk, f.onset);
 *       log_step(&rdk.last);                           // 24 bytes: what a replay needs
 *
 *   A global-motion gabor array: the elements are written straight into
 *   ysp/gfx.h's instance records, with no copy:
 *
 *       yrdk_write(&rdk, &(yrdk_out){
 *           .xy  = &items[0].x,   .xy_stride  = sizeof items[0],
 *           .dir = &items[0].ori, .dir_stride = sizeof items[0] });
 *
 *   Transparent motion is two fields (two streams, two directions) drawn
 *   as two DOTS stimuli.
 *
 *   PsychoPy and Psychtoolbox, for comparison:
 *
 *       dots = visual.DotStim(win, nDots=200, fieldSize=400, fieldShape='circle',
 *                             coherence=0.25, dir=0, speed=2, dotLife=-1,
 *                             signalDots='same', noiseDots='direction')
 *       % Psychtoolbox: DotDemo.m moves dots by hand, xy = xy + dxdy, and
 *       % replots the dots that leave or are killed (f_kill) at random.
 *
 *   The differences: PsychoPy's speed is units per frame and its dir is
 *   counterclockwise from +x with y up; here speed is units per second
 *   (CLOCK_FRAMES gives per-frame steps) and direction turns clockwise on
 *   the screen, y down, as ysp/gfx.h's ori. PsychoPy truncates the signal
 *   count (int(coherence * nDots)); EXACT rounds it. Both replot a dot that
 *   leaves at a random position, which is not density-preserving (EDGES);
 *   WRAP is the default here. Neither can regenerate a trial on another
 *   machine bit for bit.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   THE FIELD
 *     A field holds sets x count dots (count shown per update; sets 1 but
 *     for MN) in an aperture centered on 0, 0 in the caller's units (px or
 *     deg), x right, y down. yrdk_start(seed, t) places every dot at
 *     random and starts the trial's clock at t; each yrdk_update(t)
 *     advances one set to time t; yrdk_xy() and yrdk_write() give the
 *     set shown. Fields are independent values: two of them make
 *     transparent motion.
 *   SIGNAL AND NOISE
 *     On each update a dot is signal or noise. A signal dot moves by
 *     speed x elapsed time along direction. A noise dot follows the noise
 *     rule (desc.noise; Scase, Braddick and Raymond 1996):
 *       YRDK_NOISE_DIRECTION (0)  its own direction, drawn at birth, at
 *                                   the signal speed ("random direction";
 *                                   PsychoPy's noiseDots='direction')
 *       YRDK_NOISE_POSITION       a random position each update ("random
 *                                   position"; the "white noise" of
 *                                   Britten, Shadlen, Newsome and Movshon
 *                                   1992)
 *       YRDK_NOISE_WALK           a direction drawn afresh each update,
 *                                   at the signal speed ("random walk";
 *                                   Pilly and Seitz's "Brownian")
 *     Which dots are signal (desc.signal):
 *       YRDK_SIGNAL_SAME (0)      the same dots all trial (Williams and
 *                                   Sekuler 1984 "same"): those with the
 *                                   smallest keys drawn at start, so a
 *                                   coherence change converts the dots at
 *                                   the boundary and a reborn dot keeps its
 *                                   role
 *       YRDK_SIGNAL_DIFFERENT     chosen afresh each update (Williams and
 *                                   Sekuler 1984 "different"; Britten et al.
 *                                   1992)
 *       YRDK_SIGNAL_LEAST_RECENT  afresh each update, but the dots that
 *                                   have been signal longest are the first
 *                                   to become noise (Law and Gold 2008, as
 *                                   Pilly and Seitz 2009 describe it;
 *                                   Snowden and Braddick 1989): below
 *                                   coherence 0.5 no dot is signal on two
 *                                   updates of its set in a row
 *     How many (desc.select):
 *       YRDK_EXACT (0)            round(coherence x count) every update:
 *                                   the realized coherence is the stated one
 *       YRDK_BERNOULLI            each dot with probability coherence, so
 *                                   the count is binomial (the Shadlen lab's
 *                                   dotsX.m: L = rand(ndots,1) < coh)
 *     In both, a dot's key is a random 32-bit word; EXACT takes the dots
 *     with the smallest keys and BERNOULLI those below coherence x 2^32.
 *     So the signal dots at a higher coherence include those at a lower
 *     one, and the noise dots of both draw the same words (FROZEN NOISE).
 *   PRESETS (desc.algorithm; Pilly and Seitz 2009's names)
 *       YRDK_CUSTOM (0)  the rule fields as given
 *       YRDK_WN    white noise       DIFFERENT, BERNOULLI, POSITION, 1 set
 *       YRDK_MN    Movshon/Newsome   DIFFERENT, BERNOULLI, POSITION, 3 sets
 *       YRDK_LL    limited lifetime  LEAST_RECENT, EXACT, POSITION, 3 sets
 *       YRDK_BM    Brownian motion   DIFFERENT, EXACT, WALK, 1 set
 *     A preset with any rule field (signal, select, noise, sets) set is
 *     refused, so a preset never overrides a field silently.
 *   INTERLEAVED SETS (desc.sets, 0 = 1, at most YRDK_MAX_SETS)
 *     Update k (1, 2, ...) moves set (k - 1) mod sets, by the time since
 *     that set's own last update, and shows only that set. With 3 sets
 *     (MN) a dot is shown every third frame and a signal dot jumps three
 *     frames' distance at the same speed (Pilly and Seitz 2009).
 *   LIFETIME (desc.lifetime in s, or desc.lifetime_frames x frame_ns)
 *     A fixed lifetime L: a dot dies at a scheduled time, and the first
 *     update at or after it places the dot at random (and draws its
 *     direction under NOISE_DIRECTION); it does not move on that update.
 *     The next death is the old one plus L (plus as many L as the update
 *     passed), not the update's time plus L, so the mean life is exactly L
 *     even when L is not a whole number of frames: lives then take the
 *     two neighboring frame counts. At start the remaining lives are
 *     uniform over (0, L]: equal ages would make every dot die on the same
 *     update, a pulse every L. 0 = unlimited.
 *     Not offered: a death probability per update (Psychtoolbox's DotDemo
 *     f_kill, geometric lives). It is defined per update, not per second,
 *     so a dropped frame or another refresh rate changes the lifetime.
 *     To replicate DotDemo, a fixed lifetime of 1 / f_kill frames under
 *     CLOCK_FRAMES has the same mean life (not the same distribution);
 *     the geometric distribution itself is not supported.
 *   EDGES (desc.edge)
 *     YRDK_WRAP (0) keeps a uniform density uniform, exactly:
 *       RECT    a torus: x modulo the width, y modulo the height. Each axis
 *               is a translation modulo a length, which preserves length.
 *       CIRCLE  a dot is translated modulo the length of its own chord:
 *               the line of its motion cuts the disc in a chord of length
 *               2 sqrt(R^2 - s^2), s its distance from the center, and a
 *               dot that leaves goes back along that line by the chord's
 *               length (by a multiple of it for a longer step). On each
 *               chord the motion is a rotation of a circle of that length;
 *               the chords tile the disc, so area is preserved, for every
 *               direction, per dot and per update.
 *     Wraps that are NOT density-preserving, measured in docs/rdk.md:
 *       p -> -p (the point reflection) puts the dot outside for an update,
 *       and short chords lose more of their time, so density falls toward
 *       the sides parallel to the motion; re-entry at a uniform point of
 *       the circumference ignores the flux (|cos| of the angle to the
 *       motion), so dots pile up at those sides. The Shadlen lab's code
 *       moves dots in the bounding square and masks a circle: density is
 *       kept, but the shown count varies from frame to frame (RECT here and
 *       a CIRCLE aperture on the ygfx_dots stimulus give that display).
 *     YRDK_REPLOT places a dot that leaves at a random position (PsychoPy
 *     DotStim, Psychtoolbox DotDemo). Not density-preserving: nothing
 *     enters across the trailing edge but replots, so long-lived signal
 *     dots thin out toward it, over about speed x lifetime (the whole
 *     chord with no lifetime). At low coherence that gradient is a cue to
 *     the direction. Kept to replicate those programs.
 *     With WRAP and no lifetime a signal dot keeps its identity all trial
 *     and can be tracked: set a lifetime to prevent it.
 *   TIME (desc.clock)
 *     YRDK_CLOCK_ONSET (0)  an update moves its set by t minus that set's
 *              last t. Pass f.onset, the predicted onset of the frame being
 *              drawn: a dropped frame (the next onset two periods on) moves
 *              dots two periods' distance, so speed, duration and lifetimes
 *              hold in seconds. The frame that was late shows its positions
 *              a period late; nothing can repair it. Any int64 clock works:
 *              a ysp/timeline.h base time runs the field at that base's rate.
 *     YRDK_CLOCK_FRAMES     each update counts frame_ns (desc; f.period
 *              is the usual value) whatever t says: the displacement per
 *              shown frame is fixed, which paradigms defined by displacement
 *              need (Dmax; Pilly and Seitz's spatial displacement; MN's
 *              Delta-x). A dropped frame then delays the rest of the
 *              trajectory by a frame: the trial is short of distance and the
 *              speed is wrong over that interval. t is still checked and
 *              logged.
 *     t before the last update is refused (YRDK_ERR_ORDER): a field is
 *     a stochastic history, so going back is a restart and a replay
 *     (yrdk_replay), or a restore of a snapshot. An update at the same t
 *     moves nothing but still runs the selection and the noise rule (an
 *     update is an update). coherence, direction and speed hold over
 *     (last t, t]. A negative speed moves the other way; a non-finite one
 *     moves nothing; a non-finite direction is 0.
 *   FROZEN NOISE
 *     Every random word is a pure function of (seed, stream, dot, update,
 *     slot) (REPRODUCIBILITY), never of what other dots did. With the same
 *     seed at two coherence levels, a dot that is noise on an update in
 *     both runs draws the same words there: under NOISE_POSITION it lands
 *     on the same point; under WALK and DIRECTION it takes the same
 *     direction (its position also carries its history, which differs
 *     where it was signal in one run). Reverse correlation and motion
 *     energy analyses can therefore reuse one noise sequence across trials.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   REPRODUCIBILITY: the exact rules
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Any language with 64-bit integers reproduces a field from this section
 *   (tests/compare/rdk_ref.py is such a model, in Python). No floating
 *   point takes part in the state: a float input is read as the exact
 *   rational it is, and rnd(r) = floor(r + 1/2) of that rational.
 *   LATTICE   S = 2^30. Rmax = the larger half-size (CIRCLE w / 2; RECT
 *             max(w, h) / 2) is S lattice steps. CIRCLE: x^2 + y^2 <= S^2.
 *             RECT: -hx <= x < hx, -hy <= y < hy, hx = rnd(S w / max(w, h)),
 *             hy = rnd(S h / max(w, h)). A position is two int32.
 *   ANGLES    a direction is a uint32, 2^32 per turn, from +x toward +y:
 *             angle(deg) = rnd(deg 2^32 / 360) mod 2^32. sincos(a) is Q30
 *             from the literal tables below by angle addition: quadrant a
 *             >> 30; coarse i = bits 29..22, fine j = bits 21..14, rest e =
 *             bits 13..0; sAB = rnd2(sC cF + cC sF), cAB = rnd2(cC cF - sC
 *             sF) with sC = coarse[i], cC = coarse[256 - i], sF = fine_sin[j],
 *             cF = fine_cos[j]; te = (e PIH) >> 32; s = sAB + rnd2(cAB te),
 *             c = cAB - rnd2(sAB te), where rnd2(z) = floor((z + 2^29) /
 *             2^30); then by quadrant 1: (c, -s), 2: (-s, -c), 3: (-c, s).
 *   STEP      D = rnd(|speed| dt 2^30 / (Rmax 10^9)), dt in ns, at most
 *             2^62; a step along angle a is (rnd2(D c), rnd2(D s)).
 *   COUNTS    count = desc.count, or llround(density x area) in double,
 *             area = 3.141592653589793 x r x r (CIRCLE, r = w / 2, left to
 *             right) or w x h. Lifetime L = lifetime_frames x frame_ns, or
 *             llround(lifetime x 1e9) in double. EXACT: m = rnd(c count);
 *             BERNOULLI: threshold floor(c 2^32), c clamped to 0..1.

 *             Shaw 2011) with key (seed low 32 bits, seed high 32 bits) and
 *             counter (dot, u, slot, stream): four words w0..w3. dot is the
 *             index in the field (0 .. sets x count - 1), u the update
 *             number (0 for start).
 *   PLACING   P(dot, u): tries k = 0..32; try 0 is (w2, w3) of slot 0, try
 *             k >= 1 is (w0, w1) or (w2, w3) (k odd, even) of slot
 *             (k + 1) / 2. A try (a, b) is x = ((a 2hx) >> 32) - hx, y =
 *             ((b 2hy) >> 32) - hy (hx = hy = S for CIRCLE); RECT takes the
 *             first try, CIRCLE the first with x^2 + y^2 <= S^2. If all 33
 *             fail (probability 9.7e-23 per placement) the dot goes to
 *             0, 0, counted in stats.exhausted.
 *   START     u = 0; for each dot: P(dot, 0); its direction w1 of slot 0;
 *             with a lifetime, its death t + 1 + ((w0 + 2^32 w1 of slot
 *             17) x L) >> 64. Every set's last time is t, last update 0.
 *   UPDATE    u += 1; set s = (u - 1) mod sets, its dots in index order.
 *             The clock: now = t, dt = t - T_s (ONSET); now = start t + u
 *             frame_ns, dt = (u - U_s) frame_ns (FRAMES). The
 *             signal angle is angle(direction), + 2^31 for a negative speed.
 *             Keys: SAME w0 of (dot, 0, slot 0); else w0 of (dot, u, 0).
 *             Signal: BERNOULLI key < threshold; EXACT the m dots of the set
 *             smallest by (key, index), LEAST_RECENT by (run, key, index),
 *             run = the dot's consecutive signal updates (at most 65535),
 *             then run = signal ? run + 1 : 0. Then for each dot of the set,
 *             in index order: if its death <= now: P(dot, u), a new direction
 *             (NOISE_DIRECTION: w1 of slot 0), death += L until > now, no
 *             motion. Else a signal dot steps along the signal angle; a
 *             noise dot: POSITION P(dot, u); WALK direction = w1 of slot 0,
 *             then steps; DIRECTION steps along its own. A step leaves the
 *             aperture when the point lands outside, or when D > 2S (CIRCLE).
 *             Then: REPLOT P(dot, u); WRAP RECT the torus, x' = ((x + hx +
 *             dx) mod 2hx) - hx and the same for y; WRAP
 *             CIRCLE: along = rnd2(x c + y s), e = max(0, x^2 + y^2 -
 *             along^2), h = isqrt(S^2 - e), L = 2h; u0 = clamp(along + h, 0,
 *             L), u1 = (u0 + D) mod L, p' = p + (rnd2((u1 - u0) c), rnd2((u1
 *             - u0) s)); if p' is outside, u1 is clamped to 2..L - 2 and p'
 *             computed again, and if it is still outside (or L < 4) the dot
 *             stays. T_s = t, U_s = u.
 *   DIGEST    FNV-1a 64 over, per dot: x, y, direction (uint32 little-
 *             endian), flags (one byte), run (uint16, LEAST_RECENT only),
 *             death (int64, with a lifetime only); then u, then each set's
 *             T_s and U_s (int64).
 *   Log per trial, to regenerate it: YRDK_VERSION_STRING (the rules are
 *   versioned), the desc (every field), seed and stream, the t of
 *   yrdk_start, and rdk.last after each update (t, coherence, direction,
 *   speed). With fixed parameters the update times suffice; under the
 *   onset clock with t = f.onset they are the flips' targets in
 *   ysp/screen.h's ring. Log yrdk_digest() at the trial's end: a replay
 *   that gives the same digest is the same trial. Positions integrate their
 *   history, so a replay from update k needs the state at k: keep
 *   yrdk_snapshot() at k, or run from start (a replay costs what the
 *   updates cost: docs/rdk.md, "Cost").
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   OUTPUT
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yrdk_xy() writes the shown set as x, y float pairs (ygfx_dots's
 *   buffer). yrdk_write() writes any of x, y; direction (deg, the way the
 *   dot moved on its last update, or its own direction); age (s since its
 *   last birth by lifetime, or since start); signal (0 or 1); event
 *   (YRDK_EV_WRAPPED, YRDK_EV_PLACED: the dot jumped on its last
 *   update, so an element riding it restarts its carrier), each with a
 *   byte stride (0 = packed). x = (float)(x_lattice x Rmax 2^-30) in
 *   double. Outputs are never read back.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   open() allocates once, yrdk_bytes(desc) bytes, or uses desc.mem
 *   (mem_bytes at least that, 64-byte aligned is best): per dot 13 bytes
 *   (x, y, direction, flags), plus 8 under NOISE_DIRECTION (its sine and
 *   cosine, kept), 2 with LEAST_RECENT and 8 with a lifetime; plus 20 per
 *   shown dot of scratch (the update's words and the selection's indices).
 *   10,000 dots of WN take about 330 KB. Nothing after open() allocates. Define YRDK_MALLOC and YRDK_FREE to replace malloc.
 *   A field is used by one thread at a time; two fields are independent.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Link libm on Linux. Define YRDK_API to change the linkage. The state
 *   needs two's complement int64 with arithmetic right shifts (checked at
 *   compile time) and nothing of the floating-point environment: no flag
 *   (-ffast-math, -ffp-contract, /fp:fast) changes a result (the test
 *   passes built with gcc -Ofast -march=native; the finite checks read
 *   the bits).
 *
 *   LICENSE: public domain / MIT-0; the notice is at the end of the file.
