/* ysp/outline.h - v0.2.1 - public domain single-header outline builder:
 *   paths, font outlines, overlap removal, strokes, exact alpha and curve
 *   sets for ysp/gfx.h
 *
 *   The CPU side of text and artwork. It reads glyph outlines from
 *   TrueType and CFF fonts, builds paths of quadratic Bezier curves from C
 *   calls, removes overlaps, expands strokes into fills, computes the exact
 *   box-filter coverage of each pixel (value-exact text), and writes curve
 *   sets: the curves and bands ysp/gfx.h draws by Lengyel's Slug algorithm
 *   (format v1, docs/gfx.md "Curve sets: the format"). The pack tool
 *   calls it; a program without a pack can call it at load to build text
 *   from a font file.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no OS calls, no threads, no I/O. Needs nothing but libm.
 *   Not a transport header, so it does not include ysp/rt.h, and it does
 *   not include ysp/gfx.h. C99 is the floor: it builds as C99, C11 and
 *   C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.2.1 - TrueType glyphs sit where HarfBuzz puts them: an outline whose
 *          glyf xMin differs from its hmtx left side bearing moves by the
 *          difference (FONTS, "Placement"). Output changes for such glyphs
 *          only: one in Arial, one in Times New Roman.
 *   v0.2.0 - the SVG subset reader (yol_svg, SVG). Strokes: a round join or
 *          cap is the sector of its disk that no band covers, not the whole
 *          disk, and the bands' end lines pass through the segment's ends so
 *          they cancel against the joins' spokes: 2.8 to 4.6 times fewer
 *          positions and crossings in the sweep (docs/outline.md). Tried
 *          and deleted, by measurement: a persistent strip order in the
 *          sweep, and a fitted cubic conversion.
 *   v0.1.0 - first version. Paths, transforms, cubics and arcs; a bounded
 *          TrueType (glyf) and CFF (Type 2, CID-keyed included) reader;
 *          overlap removal; strokes with Nehab's (2020) evolute elements;
 *          exact alpha; curve sets with the RESOLVED flag (docs/outline.md).
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.2.1. Built and run with MSVC 19.44 (/W4 /WX, C11 and C++17),
 *   MinGW-w64 gcc 16.1 (C99, C11, C++17) and gcc 11.4 on Linux under ASan
 *   and UBSan; the desc literals as C++20. tests/adapt/outline_test.c
 *   writes its own TrueType, CFF and CID-keyed CFF fonts and SVG files and
 *   checks, against references that do not share the header's code:
 *   - curve sets: the format's test vector word for word, ygfx_cset_check()
 *     on every set, band membership and order recomputed from the texels,
 *     the winding equal to ygfx_cset_winding() at every sampled point;
 *   - the reader: every point, implied midpoints, composites, every CFF
 *     operator, cmap 4 and 12, hmtx, collections, every bound and refusal,
 *     the placement shift of a simple glyph, a composite and a
 *     USE_MY_METRICS composite, and no shift for CFF;
 *     30000 mutated fonts without a crash;
 *   - cubics within 0.998 of the tolerance (900 random), ellipses within
 *     1.05e-5 at tol 1e-5;
 *   - resolve: 300 random shapes, area within 2e-13 of an adaptive
 *     Gauss-Kronrod reference, winding 0 or 1 and equal to the input's fill;
 *   - exact alpha within 1.8e-13 of that reference (10698 pixels);
 *   - strokes: 400 random quadratics, 0 wrong of 1254027 pixel centers
 *     against the exact band (the probe's half bands: 186 wrong on 30 of
 *     400); joins, caps, bold and inset by area within 1e-8;
 *   - SVG: shapes, path grammar, transforms, styles and colors against
 *     built paths and exact-alpha images; 33 refusals by name; 20000
 *     mutated files without a crash;
 *   - no allocator call after warm-up.
 *   On the Windows fonts (Segoe UI, Bahnschrift, Arial, Nirmala UI,
 *   Microsoft YaHei, Source Han Sans JP) every glyph tried builds a valid
 *   set. Against HarfBuzz 14.6.0 (uharfbuzz 0.56.3), every glyph of Arial
 *   (4651) and Times New Roman (4731) gives the same segments bit for bit,
 *   and the curve sets from yol_cset_add_font() and from HarfBuzz's
 *   outlines are the same word for word. tests/mutate/outline.toml: 67
 *   deliberate faults, 64 caught, the 3
 *   that survive change no result (docs/outline.md). Missed bars: a
 *   Latin stroke (289 to 303 us a glyph against 200) and the sets of the
 *   two heaviest fonts (Nirmala UI 77 to 85, Source Han Sans 94 to 103 us
 *   a glyph against 66). COST has the rest.

 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PATHS
 *     A path is contours of quadratic Bezier segments in double. A line is
 *     a segment whose control point equals its start, bit for bit (the
 *     curve-set convention). The builder (yol_move, _line, _quad, _cubic,
 *     _arc_to, _close, _rect, _ellipse) puts every point through the path's
 *     transform. A contour without yol_close() stays open: fills close it
 *     with a line (SVG), strokes give it caps. The first builder error
 *     sticks in p->status; yol_path_end() returns it.
 *   COORDINATES
 *     Glyphs come in em units times desc.size, y down (ysp/gfx.h's
 *     convention; the reader flips the font's y), from the pen at desc.x,
 *     desc.y on the baseline: an ascender has negative y. Artwork is in its
 *     own units. Clockwise on the screen is the positive direction:
 *     yol_path_area() is positive for it, and ygfx_cset_winding()
 *     counts +1 inside it. TrueType outer contours come out counterclockwise
 *     on the screen (winding -1); the nonzero rule does not care, so the
 *     reader does not reverse them.
 *   FILL RULES
 *     path.rule: YOL_NONZERO (fonts) or YOL_EVENODD (SVG
 *     fill-rule="evenodd").
 *   RESOLVED
 *     yol_resolve() returns the region a path fills as closed contours,
 *     clockwise on the screen, whose winding is 0 or 1 everywhere: no
 *     overlaps, no self-crossings, every vertex shared bit for bit, and
 *     flags YOL_PATH_RESOLVED. yol_stroke() and yol_raster() resolve;
 *     a curve set resolves every glyph unless desc.keep_overlaps, and then
 *     sets the glyph's RESOLVED flag (bit 2, YGFX_CSET_RESOLVED), which
 *     ysp/gfx.h's exact-area paths rely on. A glyph written with
 *     keep_overlaps never has the flag.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   FONTS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yol_font_open() reads a TrueType or OpenType font or one face of a
 *   collection (.ttc): head, maxp, hhea, hmtx, cmap (format 4 and 12), and
 *   glyf with loca, or CFF (Type 2 charstrings, local and global
 *   subroutines, CID-keyed fonts with FDArray and FDSelect format 0 or 3).
 *   yol_font_glyph() adds one glyph's outline to a path. Glyph indices
 *   come from layout (Skribidi in the pack tool and the player); this
 *   header does no shaping, kerning or bidi. yol_font_glyph_index() and
 *   yol_font_hmetrics() are cmap and hmtx lookups for simple labels.
 *   Font bytes can come from another lab's pack, so the reader treats them
 *   as hostile. Every offset and length is checked before its read, and
 *   every loop and recursion has a bound:
 *       composite depth          8
 *       composite components     4096 visits per glyph
 *       CFF operand stack        48
 *       CFF subroutine depth     10
 *       CFF charstring tokens    65536 per glyph
 *       CFF stems                96
 *       outline points           YOL_GLYPH_POINTS (2^17) per glyph
 *   A broken font gives YOL_ERR_FORMAT with the glyph named. Refused by
 *   name (YOL_ERR_REFUSED): CFF2 outlines, a font with neither glyf nor
 *   CFF, a point-matched composite component, a seac accent, Type 2
 *   arithmetic operators, a CFF FontMatrix other than 1 / unitsPerEm, and
 *   a variation instance (desc.axes): v0.1 builds the default instance of
 *   a variable font (flag YOL_FONT_VARIABLE). TrueType hinting is not
 *   run: value-exact text is exact area, not hinted.
 *   Placement: a TrueType glyph sits where HarfBuzz puts it (HarfBuzz
 *   14.6.0, src/OT/glyf/Glyph.hh, Glyph::get_points). If its glyf xMin
 *   differs from its hmtx left side bearing (lsb), the outline moves in x
 *   by lsb - xMin, as a TrueType rasterizer places its phantom points. A
 *   composite uses the shift of its last component with the
 *   USE_MY_METRICS flag, if it has one. Simple, composite and empty glyphs
 *   get the shift; CFF glyphs do not, because CFF has no phantom points.
 *   The layout engine gives glyph positions from HarfBuzz, so the outline
 *   must agree with HarfBuzz; fontTools does not shift. Arial and Times New
 *   Roman each have one glyph that moves (1 and 190 font units).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CUBICS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A cubic (CFF, yol_cubic, SVG) becomes n quadratics on a uniform split
 *   of its parameter, each with the same ends and the control point
 *   (3 (C1 + C2) - (A + B)) / 4 of its piece. The distance between the
 *   cubic and its quadratics is at most sqrt(3) / 36 |P3 - 3 P2 + 3 P1 - P0|
 *   / n^3 at every parameter, so n = ceil(cbrt(sqrt(3) / 36 |...| / tol))
 *   keeps them within tol: path.tol after the transform (0: 1e-4), or for a
 *   glyph desc.tol in em (0: 1e-4 em). Arcs and ellipses use quadratics
 *   whose largest radial error, r (1 - cos(a/2))^2 / (2 cos(a/2)) for an
 *   arc piece of angle a, is within tol after the transform.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   STROKES
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yol_stroke() follows Nehab (2020, "Converting stroked primitives to
 *   filled primitives", ACM TOG 39(4)). Each segment is split where its
 *   curvature radius equals the half width h and at its vertex. Where the
 *   radius is at least h, the segment adds a band between its two offsets.
 *   Where it is below h, the inner offset folds back; the segment then adds
 *   its outer half band, the region between itself and its evolute (the
 *   centers of curvature), and the region between the evolute and the
 *   inner offset. Joins and caps complete it: round is the sector of the
 *   disk between the two normals on the outer side (a point within half
 *   the width of a vertex whose nearest point is the vertex lies there; any
 *   other point within it is in a band), miter (with miter_limit) and bevel
 *   are the outer wedge plus the inner triangle the bands leave; caps are
 *   butt, round (a half disk) or square; a zero-length subpath is a dot. Every
 *   piece is oriented positive, so their union under the nonzero rule is
 *   the stroke with no folded hole; edges that are exact reverses cancel,
 *   and yol_resolve()'s sweep removes the rest of the overlaps. Offsets
 *   and evolutes are quadratics within tol (5 samples of each must lie
 *   within tol); a piece that does not converge within the call's budget
 *   gives YOL_ERR_NUMERIC with the point named, never a hang. mode BOLD
 *   is the fill and the stroke, INSET the fill minus the stroke.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SVG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yol_svg() reads artwork (rig_spec 5.2, Artwork) into solid-color
 *   layers, each a resolved path in viewBox units (y down, as SVG has it)
 *   for yol_cset_add(), bottom to top: a shape's fill, then its stroke.
 *   Read: <svg> (viewBox, or width and height in px), <g>, <path> (every
 *   command, arcs included), <rect> (rx, ry), <circle>, <ellipse>, <line>,
 *   <polyline>, <polygon>, an empty <defs>, and <title>, <desc> and
 *   <metadata> (skipped); the attributes transform (matrix, translate,
 *   scale, rotate, skewX, skewY), fill, fill-rule, fill-opacity, stroke,
 *   stroke-width, stroke-linejoin, stroke-linecap, stroke-miterlimit,
 *   stroke-opacity, and opacity on a shape with one paint, inherited
 *   through <g> as SVG does; colors #rgb, #rrggbb, rgb() and the 17 CSS 2
 *   names, and none. A stroke is expanded in the shape's own coordinates,
 *   then transformed, so a skewed pen is drawn as the file says. The
 *   tolerance is desc.tol, or 1e-4 of the viewBox's larger side.
 *   Refused by name (YOL_ERR_REFUSED, the message names it): every other
 *   element (filter, mask, clipPath, text, style, gradients, pattern,
 *   image, use, symbol, marker, foreignObject, a nested svg, anything
 *   unknown), the attributes style, class, clip-path, mask, filter,
 *   stroke-dasharray, vector-effect, marker*, display, visibility,
 *   paint-order, transform-origin, requiredFeatures, systemLanguage, a
 *   url() paint, currentColor and other color syntax, units other than
 *   px, opacity on a group or on a shape with fill and stroke (it needs a
 *   compositing group), a transform on <svg>, entity references, a
 *   DOCTYPE internal subset and CDATA. Other attributes (id, xmlns,
 *   version, an editor's namespaced ones) change nothing and are passed
 *   over. Malformed XML or path data is YOL_ERR_FORMAT with the byte.
 *   Bounds: element depth 64, 64 attributes an element.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   EXACTNESS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yol_raster() resolves the path, then sums for every pixel the exact
 *   signed area under each curve inside it: each monotone piece is split
 *   where it crosses a pixel row or column, and each part adds a closed
 *   form integral of x dy. That is the box-filter coverage of the pixel
 *   square in double, linear in area, with no gamma (ysp/gfx.h's linear
 *   output stage). Values within 1e-13 of 0 or 1 are stored as 0 or 1.
 *   U8 stores floor(255 c + 0.5), U16 floor(65535 c + 0.5). Draw the image
 *   on the pixel grid only: off the grid it is not exact.
 *   The resolve's sweep is exact up to rounding: output points are on the
 *   input curves, crossings are roots of a quartic refined to the double's
 *   resolution, end heights within 1e-13 of the path's extent are merged,
 *   and points within 1e-9 of it on one line are one point.
 *   The sweep's work is bounded by YOL_SWEEP_WORK piece positions (2^27,
 *   about 2 s): a more complex outline is refused (YOL_ERR_REFUSED).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CURVE SETS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   yol_cset_init() writes the header and an empty glyph table of
 *   desc.n_glyphs entries; yol_cset_add() appends one glyph: each vertex
 *   rounded to f32 once (so curves share their ends bit for bit and a
 *   contour closes on its first texel), lines with p1 = p0, the bbox from
 *   the stored f32 values, nh = nv = clamp(round(sqrt(curves)), 1, 16)
 *   unless desc.nh, desc.nv say otherwise, each band's list sorted as the
 *   format requires with ties by ascending texel (the format's test
 *   vector), backward lists with desc.backward, then the table entry last,
 *   so ygfx_cset_add() never sees half a glyph. The arrays grow on the
 *   context's allocator, or stay in the caller's storage (ctx NULL at
 *   init; growth past the caps is YOL_ERR_FULL).
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The context holds the allocator (desc.realloc, or the C library's, or
 *   a fixed arena in desc.mem: no heap at all) and scratch buffers that
 *   grow to the largest glyph seen and are reused. After the first glyphs
 *   of a font, building, resolving and rasterizing glyphs make no
 *   allocator call (the test counts them). A context is for one thread;
 *   fonts are read-only and threads may share one.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   COST
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Measured on the Iris Xe laptop on AC power, under the shared
 *   measurement lock, medians of 3 interleaved rounds, gcc 16.1 -O2 to
 *   MSVC 19.44 /O2 (examples/outline/bench.c measures your machine):

 *   The sweep's cost grows with the curves and their crossings; a stroke
 *   has 5 to 10 times its glyph's curves before the resolve.

 *   Layout, shaping, bidi and kerning (Skribidi). Hinting. Font variations

 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Link libm on Linux. Define YOL_API to override the default `extern`
