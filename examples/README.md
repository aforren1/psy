# Examples

One program per file. CMake builds `examples/<lib>/<name>.c` as the
program `<lib>_<name>` (for example `examples/gfx/gallery.c` is
`gfx_gallery`). Some examples sit in the folder of the header they mainly
show but use another header's build; they keep their own file name as
their program name (`YSP_EXAMPLES_ACROSS` in `CMakeLists.txt`):
`rdk/gfx_rdk.c`, `rdk/gfx_rdk_bench.c`, `rdk/trial_rdk.c`, `timeline/gfx_trial.c`,
`layout/gfx_layout.c`, `device/photodiode_check.c` and the
`response/trial_*.c`; `net/labstreamer_flip.c` is `net_labstreamer_flip`
and `audio/av_sync.c` is `audio_av_sync`.

Run a program from the build folder (`build/<preset>/Release/` with MSVC,
`build/<preset>/` otherwise). "Needs" says what a run needs beyond the
build: SDL3 (a window), ANGLE (GL ES on Windows), a font, a device, or
nothing. `--sim` runs a windowed example on the simulated display, which
needs nothing; CI runs the commands marked "CI".
