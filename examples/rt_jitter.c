/* rt_jitter.c - measure what psy_rt.h's waits are worth on THIS machine.
 *
 * Elevates the calling thread, then times psyrt_sleep_until() against a
 * running absolute deadline for a few spin windows and prints the wake
 * latency distribution for each. Ends with a one-shot deadline worker, so the
 * worker path is exercised too. Nothing here needs hardware.
 *
 * The numbers are the point. psy_rt.h states no latency figure of its own;
 * this program is where a figure for your rig comes from. Run it on the
 * experiment machine, in the state the experiment runs in (same power plan,
 * same background load), and record the psy_rt: line with the numbers.
 *
 * One of the windows swept is PSYRT_DEFAULT_SPIN_NS, marked (default) in the
 * output. That default is a starting point chosen per platform, not a
 * measurement of your machine: compare its row with the others and pass your
 * own window to psyrt_sleep_until() or psyrt_worker_desc.spin_ns.
 *
 * Build (from the repository root):
 *     cc -O2 -pthread -I. -o rt_jitter examples/rt_jitter.c   # Linux / macOS
 *     cl /O2 /I. examples\rt_jitter.c                         # Windows (MSVC)
 * or:  cmake -B build && cmake --build build
 *
 * Usage: rt_jitter [iterations] [period_us]
 *     rt_jitter             # 200 waits of 2 ms per spin window
 *     rt_jitter 1000 5000   # 1000 waits of 5 ms per spin window
 *
 * Exit code: 0 always, including with no privileges and no real-time policy.
 * A refused policy is a result, not a failure; it shows up in the psy_rt:
 * line and in the numbers.
