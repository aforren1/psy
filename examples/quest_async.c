/* quest_async.c - run QUEST+ on a background thread, from a frame loop.
 *
 * The shape docs/psy_adapt.md asks for in "Inference on a thread", and the
 * reason psy_quest.h has an ASYNC section: a trial loop that must not miss a
 * 16 ms frame, and a selection that takes longer than the loop wants to wait.
 * The loop submits the response and goes back to drawing; the thread runs
 * psyq_update() and psyq_next(); the loop reads the next stimulus out of the
 * snapshot when the inter-trial interval ends. The frame budget stops being a
 * hard constraint and becomes a contract the program can check, which is what
 * this program checks and prints.
 *
 * The grid here is Psi-marginal (Prins 2013), 31 stimuli by 61 x 12 x 5 x 5
 * parameters with guess and lapse flagged nuisance: about 1.1 M table cells,
 * which examples/quest_bench.c measures at one to two milliseconds per
 * selection. That fits a frame, so this program also does the opposite
 * measurement: it reports how much of the interval the inference actually used,
 * which is the number that tells you whether a bigger grid would still fit.
 *
 * Nothing here needs hardware, a privilege or a display. The observer is
 * simulated from a fixed seed, so two runs on one machine differ only by the
 * machine's timing.
 *
 * Build (from the repository root):
 *     cc -O2 -pthread -I. -o quest_async examples/quest_async.c -lm
 *     cl /O2 /I. examples\quest_async.c
 *
 * Usage: quest_async [trials] [frames_per_trial]
 *     quest_async          # 60 trials, 30 frames (480 ms) of interval each
 *     quest_async 100 10   # 100 trials, 10 frames of interval
 *
 * Exit code: 0 always. A proposal that was not ready in time is a measurement,
 * not a failure; so is a full queue, which this program reports.
