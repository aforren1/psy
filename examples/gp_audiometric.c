/* gp_audiometric - the audiometric test function of Owen et al. 2021 on psy_gp.h.
 *
 * Owen et al. (2021), "Adaptive nonparametric psychophysics"
 * (arXiv:2104.09549), the AEPsych paper, compares level-set and global
 * acquisition functions on a synthetic audiometric observer: a hearing
 * threshold in dB HL that varies with frequency, and a probit psychometric
 * function of intensity around it. This program runs that comparison on
 * psy_gp.h's own acquisitions and adds the classical baseline the paper left
 * out, a set of interleaved weighted staircases from psy_stair.h.
 *
 * THE OBSERVER
 * Four age-related-hearing-loss phenotypes, each given as a hearing threshold
 * at 8 audiometric frequencies (0.25 to 8 kHz). The numbers are the ones Owen
 * et al. scraped from Figure 2 of Dubno, Eckert, Lee, Matthews & Schmiedt
 * (2013), "Classifying human audiometric phenotypes of age-related hearing
 * loss from animal models", JARO 14:687-701; they are that paper's phenotype
 * means, not anything this file invented. Between the 8 points the curve is a
 * not-a-knot cubic spline in kHz (linear frequency, not log), which agrees with
 * SciPy's interp1d(kind='cubic') to the six digits SciPy was asked to print.
 * Beyond them, out to the 0.125 and 16 kHz ends of the box, this file extends
 * the end TANGENT rather than the end cubic; SciPy's fill_value="extrapolate"
 * extends the cubic, which reaches 91 dB HL at 16 kHz on the older-normal
 * phenotype from a 13 dB measurement at 8 kHz.
 *
 * The latent field is f(xc, xi) = (xi - theta(xc)) / beta with xc = log2 of
 * the frequency in kHz and xi the intensity in dB HL, and p = Phi(f). beta is
 * the psychometric width in dB: the whole probit rise takes about 5.2 * beta
 * dB, so beta = 0.2 is a step function on the scale of the box and beta = 10
 * is a ramp across half of it.
 *
 * THE PROTOCOL, as the paper defines it
 * 150 trials: 5 quasi-random init trials (the paper's Sobol, Halton here) then
 * 145 adaptive ones. Target threshold p = 0.75. One replication is one seed;
 * the methods are the paper's LSE, BALV and BALD, this header's EAVC and
 * LOCALMI, and PSYGP_ACQ_RANDOM as the paper's quasi-random baseline, each on
 * the RBF probit GP with fitted hyperparameters, plus three of them again on
 * the semiparametric kernel, this header's analog of the paper's
 * linear-additive model, and five more (semip2-lse, -balv, -bald, -eavc and
 * -localmi) on PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC, Keeley et al. 2023's semiparametric
 * model in its own form: a threshold GP and a log-slope GP over frequency and
 * a probit in intensity. lse-mono, eavc-mono and bald-mono are lse, eavc and
 * bald with desc.monotone_dims set along the intensity, the posterior mean
 * projected to rise with level (MONOTONIC PROJECTION in psy_gp.h).
 *
 * THE METRICS, as the paper defines them
 * On a 30 x 30 grid over the box, (a) the mean absolute error of the model's
 * E[p] against the true p, and (b) the mean absolute error of the 0.75
 * threshold in dB: per context column, the two grid points that bracket 0.75
 * along intensity, linearly interpolated, done identically for the truth and
 * for the model, averaged over the columns where both cross. Columns where one
 * does not cross are counted and reported, not scored. And (c), not the
 * paper's: MAE(p) again over the transition band alone, the grid points whose
 * true p is in [0.05, 0.95], as tests/compare/compare_gp_aepsych.py defines it.
 * The band is a few points per column, so (a) mostly measures the flat floor
 * and ceiling, and (c) is where a model has to represent the rise itself. The
 * CSV carries it as a last column, mae_band.
 *
 * THE CLASSICAL BASELINE
 * Eight interleaved weighted 1-up-1-down staircases, one per measured
 * frequency, round robin, 150 trials in total, 5 dB steps after a 10 dB
 * opening step, starting at 40 dB, threshold from the reversal mean. Scored
 * with the same two metrics by reading its 8 thresholds as a threshold curve
 * (linear in log2 frequency, end segments extended) and its p as
 * Phi((xi - threshold) / beta) with beta KNOWN. That last part is a best case
 * that no staircase gets in a real experiment: it is given the psychometric
 * width for free, while the GP has to learn it.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS
 * Measured on one core of an x86-64 desktop under WSL2, gcc -O2, at the end of
 * a 150-trial session on this box with M = 231 candidates: psygp_next() 1.0 to
 * 1.3 ms under LSE and 6.2 to 7.3 ms under EAVC, psygp_update() 0.6 to 0.9 ms,
 * one whole psygp_fit() 170 to 490 ms from cold, and the 900-point metric grid
 * 9.4 ms through psygp_predict_p_many() (10.5 us per point) against 9.7 to
 * 11.0 ms through 900 psygp_predict_p() calls (10.8 to 12.2 us per point). The
 * batched call is what this program scores with, and on this configuration it is
 * worth 10 to 20 percent of the grid rather than the factor of two its manual
 * quotes: 900 points over a 150 x 150 factor is 1.6 MB of reading either way and
 * the one-point path already streams it in order. So the hyperparameter fit is
 * the expensive part of a replication and desc.fit_every is the knob: 20 trials,
 * the default here, is about 7 fits and most of a 150-trial replication.
 * Nothing here is a timing measurement of a rig. The per-trial times in
 * the summary are CPU time from clock() over psygp_next() plus psygp_update()
 * only, so the metric grid and the CSV are not charged to the frame budget. A
 * scheduled hyperparameter fit runs inside psygp_update(), so it is inside that
 * number and not beside it, which is why a method's ms/trial is several times
 * its psygp_next(). The staircase prints 0.000 because 150 of its trials
 * together are under the resolution of clock().

 * at the compiler to see what it costs. What a sweep of them on
 * metabolic+sensory found, 3 replications, beta 0.5 and 2, on a finer candidate
 * grid than the one above (15 x 25):
 *   LS_INT_MIN    lower bound on the intensity lengthscale, dB. Default
 *                 0.05 * 140 = 7 dB, which is wider than the whole psychometric
 *                 rise below beta = 1.5; dropping it to 2 dB changed not one
 *                 digit of either metric, because the fit never asks for less.
 *   OS_MAX_RBF    upper bound on the RBF output scale, a prior VARIANCE.
 *                 Default 10. Raising it to 50 costs 0.03 of MAE(p) and stalls
 *                 the surface error after 50 trials: the fit spends the room on
 *                 interpolating, and the log marginal likelihood goes from
 *                 about -24 to about -15 where 150 binary trials at a 75% level
 *                 cannot honestly beat about -84.
 *   OS_MAX_SEMIP, OS_B_MAX_SEMIP  the same two for the semiparametric
 *                 intercept and slope GPs. Raising either (to 400 and 1e4, and
 *                 to 100) moves MAE(p) by 0.002 and MAE(threshold) by 0.02 dB.
 *                 The semiparametric fit is not short of room: with a level-set
 *                 acquisition it separates its own trials, which sends the slope
 *                 output scale to its ceiling and the log marginal likelihood to
 *                 -2.7, and leaves the threshold near the middle of the box. */
