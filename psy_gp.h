/* psy_gp.h - v0.14.1 - public domain single-header Gaussian-process adaptive library
 *
 *   Nonparametric and semiparametric Bayesian adaptive psychophysics: a
 *   Gaussian-process model over a multidimensional stimulus space with
 *   binary, ordinal, categorical or continuous outcomes, and acquisition
 *   functions for threshold (level-set) estimation and for the whole
 *   psychometric field. The subset of AEPsych (Owen et al. 2021; Letham
 *   et al. 2022; Keeley et al. 2023) that fits in one C file with no
 *   dependencies: Laplace inference instead of variational, a candidate
 *   set instead of a gradient optimizer, the semiparametric model as a
 *   kernel, and the look-ahead acquisitions through a rank-one update.
 *
 *   Written in the single-header style of the stb / sokol libraries. Pure
 *   computation: no OS calls, no threads. One allocation at open, none
 *   after. Needs nothing but libm. Not a transport header, so it does not
 *   include psy_rt.h, unless PSYGP_ASYNC asks for the optional thread that
 *   runs the inference off the frame loop; see ASYNC.
 *
 *   Targets every platform the compiler does. C99 is the floor: it builds as
 *   C99, C11 and C++17, and in the C dialect MSVC compiles by default.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   CHANGELOG
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   v0.14.1 - two fixes. (1) A desc.memory buffer that was not 8-byte
 *          aligned: psygp_open() aligned the base, but every later call laid
 *          its scratch out from the unaligned address, so the quadrature
 *          weights and every scratch vector read a few bytes off what open()
 *          had written (the macOS CI failure: outcome probabilities summing
 *          to 8e280, in the build whose static test buffer landed on an odd
 *          address). malloc'd handles were never affected. (2)
 *          psygp_threshold()'s band read an unset edge when neither shifted
 *          curve crossed; the band is now the whole box there, which is what
 *          the unset read produced in practice. Results with malloc'd or
 *          aligned memory are v0.14.0's to the bit.
 *   v0.14.0 - desc.fit_pcg (a new field at the end of psygp_desc, off by
 *          default): conjugate-gradient Newton steps in a fit's evaluations
 *          and in the psychometric model's mode search, rejected line-search
 *          points undone by a copy, and no refit of a point the model already
 *          stands at; 2.6 times on a 500-trial 6-D GP fit and 3.7 times on
 *          the psychometric model's. The explicit B^-1 of the gradient walks
 *          rows instead of columns, 2.7 times faster with the same bits, so
 *          every result at the defaults is v0.13.1's. See CONJUGATE GRADIENTS
 *          IN A FIT under MEMORY, COST AND THREADS.
 *   v0.13.1 - no code change. The 6-D contrast sensitivity problem's stuck
 *          flat model (guess 0.5, mean at its bound, p = 0.5 everywhere)
 *          is v0.4.1's behavior, fixed since v0.5.0 by the mean prior; the
 *          test now replays its first 30 trials with and without the prior.
 *          The cost section quotes the 6-D numbers.
 *   v0.13.0 - desc.fit_max_evals and desc.fit_tol (0 = the old 40 and 1e-8),
 *          psygp_fit() returns 1 when converged and 0 when the budget ran
 *          out (it returned 0 for both), and psygp_fit_delta() reads the
 *          objective's change. A psygp_fit() after one the budget stopped
 *          continues with its step length. A caller that tested
 *          psygp_fit() == 0 for success must test >= 0. Scheduled fits, and
 *          so every session result at the defaults, are v0.12.0's.
 *   v0.12.0 - snapshots: psygp_save_size(), psygp_save() and psygp_load(), a
 *          versioned little-endian byte image of the whole session that
 *          resumes it bit for bit without replay. See SNAPSHOTS under
 *          MEMORY, COST AND THREADS.
 *   v0.11.0 - desc.pcg_threshold: above it (default 512, so never at the
 *          default PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS), an update's Newton steps are
 *          preconditioned conjugate-gradient solves with the previous factor
 *          as the preconditioner, 2.6 to 3.3 times faster from N = 1024 on.
 *          The history moves from the handle into the memory block, so the
 *          handle is 2.5 KB and PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS can be raised to 2048 with
 *          the caller's memory; psygp_memory_size() grows by 144 bytes a
 *          trial. psygp_desc gains pcg_threshold at its end.
 *   v0.10.0 - desc.monotone_dims, AEPsych's monotonic projection of the
 *          posterior mean along the masked dimensions, for predict_p,
 *          predict_p_many, predict_p_var, the threshold and the level-set
 *          acquisitions; a new field at the end of psygp_desc. The copies
 *          whose count is an int are loops instead of memcpy, which gcc 13's
 *          -Wstringop-overflow flagged at -O3 under _FORTIFY_SOURCE; results
 *          are v0.9.0's to the bit. See MONOTONIC PROJECTION under KERNELS.
 *   v0.9.0 - mixed parameters: desc.dim_kind[] (CONTINUOUS, INTEGER,
 *          CATEGORICAL) and desc.dim_levels[], new fields at the end of
 *          psygp_desc that a binding must add. A categorical kernel factor
 *          exp(-(1 - delta) / l); candidates, init points, refinement,
 *          updates and threshold contexts honor the kinds. A description
 *          with every dimension CONTINUOUS gives v0.8.0's results to the bit.
 *          See DIMENSION KINDS under KERNELS.
 *   v0.8.0 - PSYGP_LIK_PAIRWISE, comparisons of two stimuli, with
 *          psygp_next_pair(), psygp_update_pair() and psygp_predict_pair().
 *          psygp_trial gains x2 at its end and the handle a second stimulus
 *          array; a binding that mirrors psygp_trial must add the field.
 *          Nothing else changes. See MODEL and examples/gp_pairwise.c.
 *   v0.7.0 - optimization: PSYGP_ACQ_UCB, PSYGP_ACQ_EI and PSYGP_ACQ_THOMPSON
 *          for finding the stimulus the observer prefers most, desc.minimize
 *          (a new field at the end of psygp_desc), and psygp_argmax(). See
 *          ACQUISITION and examples/gp_optimize.c. Nothing else changes.
 *   v0.6.0 - desc.priors: every weak-prior parameter at run time, a
 *          {center, sd, ceiling} per hyperparameter with zero meaning the
 *          measured default, and psygp_get_priors() to read what is in force.
 *          The compile-time PSYGP__PS_MG_RISE, PSYGP__PRIOR_MG_SD,
 *          PSYGP__PS_MG_HI and PSYGP__PS_OS_G are gone. psygp_desc gains
 *          priors at its end, so a binding that mirrors it must add the
 *          field; at the defaults every result is v0.5.0's to the bit.
 *   v0.5.0 - three defects the cross-method comparison
 *          (tests/compare/methods_compare.py) found, fixed, each with its
 *          recorded trials replayed in the test. (1) A psychometric-model fit
 *          could restore its accepted point from a rejected point's mode, run
 *          the mode search into its step cap on a saturated plateau, and leave
 *          a log marginal likelihood of -1e49 with no error: the mode search
 *          now rejects a result below Psi at the prior mean and restarts cold
 *          (PSYGP_ERR_NUMERIC if that fails), a restore that misses its value
 *          is refitted cold, and a whole fit that ends worse than it began is
 *          undone. (2) A GP-model fit could jump to a data-favored
 *          short-lengthscale mode that redraws the level set: a fit that
 *          reclassifies more than 5% of the candidates after a settled one is
 *          undone once. (3) The GP model's mean had no prior and ran to its
 *          bound on data that are mostly one way: it now has a normal prior
 *          (sd 0.7) on the discrete likelihoods, and EAVC falls back to the
 *          straddle when its expected level set is empty or full. (2) and (3)
 *          change what the GP model computes by default; nothing changes in a
 *          run none of them touches except through the mean prior. See
 *          HYPERPARAMETERS and ACQUISITION.
 *   v0.4.1 - no behavior changed. Why PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC's fitted mean
 *          slope is about half the true one (its prior, not the Laplace
 *          approximation), and why that prior stays (every looser setting
 *          measured reopens the threshold tail under LSE and leaves the band
 *          error where it was), under HYPERPARAMETERS; and the prior's center,
 *          sd and ceiling as compile-time knobs for measuring it.
 *   v0.4.0 - three changes to PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC. Its hyperparameter
 *          gradient is analytic (one conjugate-gradient adjoint solve through
 *          the true Hessian, preconditioned by the Gauss-Newton posterior),
 *          which cuts the cost of a fit about five times. It supports EAVC and
 *          LOCALMI, through a rank-one look-ahead in the collapsed system. And
 *          the log-slope GP's output-scale prior is centered at 0.3 rather than
 *          1, which removes a 7 to 12 dB tail on the audiometric sensory
 *          phenotype. The last one changes what the model computes by default;
 *          nothing changes under PSYGP_MODEL_GP. No public struct changed.
 *   v0.3.0 - desc.model and PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC: Keeley et al. 2023's
 *          semiparametric model in its own form, a threshold GP and a
 *          log-slope GP over the context feeding a probit or logit in the
 *          intensity, for the observer whose psychometric rise is narrow
 *          against the box (see MODEL, and STATUS for what it measured).
 *          psygp_hyper gains lengthscale_g, outputscale_g and mean_g, and
 *          psygp_desc gains model; both at the end of their structs, so every
 *          earlier field keeps its offset, but both structs are larger and a
 *          binding that mirrors them must add the fields. The default model
 *          is PSYGP_MODEL_GP, and with it nothing computes differently from
 *          v0.2.1; PSYGP_KERNEL_SEMIP is unchanged.
 *   v0.2.1 - version macros (PSYGP_VERSION_MAJOR / MINOR / PATCH / STRING)
 *          and psygp_version(), so a program can log which header it was
 *          built from and a binding can read its version from the header;
 *          and desc.refine_steps, a golden-section refinement of the grid
 *          winner off the candidate set (see CANDIDATES). refine_steps is the
 *          LAST field of psygp_desc, so every earlier field keeps its offset,
 *          but the struct is larger and a binding that mirrors it must add the
 *          field. At its default of 0 nothing computes differently from v0.2.
 *   v0.2 - the optional async layer, PSYGP_ASYNC: psy_rt.h's psyrt_pump with
 *          psygp_update(), psygp_next() and psygp_threshold() on one thread, a
 *          queue of responses, a published snapshot a frame loop polls, and
 *          desc.fit_in_idle, which spends the gaps between trials on
 *          psygp_fit_step(). Nothing changed in the synchronous header, which
 *          still includes nothing but the C standard library and is bit for bit
 *          what v0.1 computed; see ASYNC.
 *   v0.1 - the implementation. All four likelihoods, both kernels, all six
 *          acquisitions, the analytic marginal-likelihood gradient (numerical
 *          under CATEGORICAL), the threshold search, and five things v0.0 did
 *          not plan: psygp_fit_step(), which makes a hyperparameter fit
 *          resumable one evaluation at a time, and desc.refit_every with
 *          psygp_refit(), which trades the exact Newton refit of every trial
 *          for an O(N^2) rank-one update, and desc.guess / desc.lapse, a
 *          floor and a ceiling on the Bernoulli and ordinal links so a
 *          two-interval task states its chance level instead of faking it.
 *          PSYGP_REAL makes the kernel matrix, the Laplace factors and the
 *          look-ahead covariance float on request; see PRECISION for what that
 *          buys, which is memory rather than time.
 *          It also fits a MAP rather than a type-II maximum likelihood: weak
 *          log-normal priors on the lengthscales and the output scales
 *          (desc.no_hyper_prior turns them off), which is what stops a nearly
 *          separable run from interpolating its own trials; psygp_next()
 *          guards against an acquisition that has stopped discriminating;
 *          and psygp_predict_p_many() / psygp_predict_f_many() evaluate a
 *          field in one blocked pass. Three changes to what
 *          v0.0 specified: EAVC measures the level set with the EXPECTED
 *          count of candidates above the level rather than the count of
 *          candidates whose mean is above it (the count is integer-valued,
 *          and it pins the acquisition to one stimulus as soon as no
 *          candidate can flip); the semiparametric kernel measures the
 *          intensity from the middle of the box; and the hyperparameter
 *          gradient under CATEGORICAL is central differences, not analytic.
 *   v0.0 - specification. Declarations and the manual, no implementation.
 *
 *   STATUS: v0.14.1. Implemented and checked by tests/adapt/psy_gp_test.c,
 *   which builds and passes as C11, C99 and C++17 under gcc with -Wall
 *   -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Werror, with and without PSYGP_ASYNC, as
 *   MSVC's default C dialect with /W4 /WX both ways, and is clean under
 *   -fsanitize=address,undefined and, with the async layer, under
 *   -fsanitize=thread.
 *   What it verifies, with the numbers it measured: the Cholesky and the
 *   triangular solves against a hand-built SPD matrix (1e-12); the kernel
 *   symmetric and positive definite on random points for both kernels; the
 *   20-node Gauss-Hermite rule integrating x^0 to x^6 against the Gaussian
 *   to 1e-11; the exact Gaussian posterior, its variance and its log
 *   marginal likelihood against a dense Gauss-Jordan solve (1e-9); the
 *   Bernoulli probit Laplace mode satisfying f = m + K grad log p(y|f) at
 *   six points (1e-8) and its predictive variance against a dense
 *   (K^-1 + W)^-1 (1e-9); the softmax mode satisfying the same condition
 *   per class with three classes (1e-7); the analytic gradient of the
 *   Laplace log
 *   marginal likelihood against central differences for every free
 *   hyperparameter under RBF and SEMIP crossed with Bernoulli, ordinal and
 *   Gaussian, and again with the logit link, worst relative error below
 *   1e-4; the rank-one look-ahead
 *   covariance against a brute-force refit with W frozen (1e-10);
 *   psygp_memory_size() exact to the byte; the Halton points; the desc
 *   validation; a caller-owned candidate list, the random acquisition and
 *   the threshold-width stop rule running a session; psygp_predict_p_many()
 *   and psygp_predict_f_many() agreeing with the one-point calls to the last
 *   bit over a 900-point grid; and a reported
 *   Cholesky failure leaving the previous
 *   posterior in force. On a simulated 1-D probit observer (slope 8,
 *   50% point 0.40, box [0, 1]) over 8 response streams of 100 trials, the
 *   mean absolute error of the 75% threshold is 0.011 for LSE, 0.010 for
 *   EAVC and 0.037 for BALD, against a binomial noise floor near 0.02 for
 *   a hundred trials; the tolerance the test enforces is 0.08. Over 20
 *   further streams outside the test the same three come out at 0.013,
 *   0.013 and 0.032, worst case 0.05, 0.04 and 0.12, with no run failing to
 *   find a crossing. The other
 *   three likelihoods recover their simulated field: rms error 0.003 for
 *   GAUSSIAN over 60 trials, 0.076 for the ordinal P(y >= 2) with four
 *   categories over 150 trials, and 0.069 for the three softmax class
 *   probabilities over 120 trials.
 *
 *   The floor and the ceiling are checked the same way: the analytic
 *   gradient still matches central differences to better than 1e-4 with
 *   guess = 0.5 and lapse = 0.02 under both links, both kernels, and both
 *   Bernoulli and ordinal; and a simulated two-interval observer
 *   (p = 0.5 + 0.48 Phi(8 (x - 0.4))) recovers its 75% threshold with a mean
 *   absolute error of 0.022 over 5 streams of 120 trials.
 *
 *   The weak priors of HYPERPARAMETERS are in the same comparison: without
 *   them the same eight streams give 0.050 for LSE and 0.043 for BALD, and
 *   two of the eight collapse onto a diffuse fit whose threshold is 0.14
 *   out. The gradient check covers them, since they are part of the
 *   objective the finite differences see, and desc.no_hyper_prior is how the
 *   comparison was run.
 *
 *   examples/gp_audiometric.c is the harder test, and the numbers that justify
 *   the priors and the acquisition guard come from it: the audiometric observer
 *   of Owen et al. 2021, four phenotypes by 20 replications of 150 trials, same
 *   seeds throughout. Pooled over the phenotypes at trial 150, threshold error
 *   in dB at beta = 2 then beta = 0.5: LOCALMI 1.74 / 1.75, LSE 2.04 / 2.28,
 *   EAVC 2.14 / 2.03, BALV 3.76 / 3.40, BALD 5.66 / 5.28, RANDOM 5.42 / 5.45,
 *   SEMIP with BALV 3.41 / 3.46, SEMIP with LSE 8.05 / 8.14, and eight
 *   interleaved staircases given the frequencies and the psychometric width
 *   2.72 / 2.07. Surface error MAE(p): BALV 0.0558 / 0.0621, which is the best
 *   of the nine in all eight phenotype-by-beta cells, then EAVC 0.0668, BALD
 *   0.0672, LOCALMI 0.0733, RANDOM 0.0763, LSE 0.0824; the staircase reads
 *   0.0186 there, with beta known for free. So the level-set acquisitions win
 *   the threshold and the variance-based ones win the field, which is the
 *   paper's own finding, and a classical staircase that is told the frequencies
 *   and the width is still competitive on both.
 *
 *   That run is also the before-and-after for the two v0.1 fixes. The weak
 *   priors: LSE was 3.20 / 3.07 dB without them and BALD 8.48 / 8.91, against
 *   2.04 / 2.28 and 5.66 / 5.28 with them, and the output scale sat at a bound
 *   in 130 of 1600 runs rather than 1580, all 130 in the BALV, LOCALMI or
 *   beta = 0.5 cells where the latent really is steep. They cost early
 *   accuracy: at trial 25, MAE(p) is 0.03 to 0.11 worse with the prior than
 *   without. The acquisition guard: SEMIP with a level-set acquisition used to
 *   separate its own data and then propose one candidate forever, and its
 *   threshold contour left the box in 7 to 19 of 30 context columns in every
 *   cell; now no cell of the 24 has a single non-crossing column. Over all 1600
 *   runs, PSYGP_ERR_NUMERIC 0 and a multi-crossing threshold 0. SEMIP with LSE
 *   at 8 dB is still the worst configuration measured, and the reason is in the
 *   model rather than the fit: see SEMIP below, and ACQUISITION for what the
 *   guard does and does not repair.
 *
 *   The two cost knobs are checked too: psygp_fit_step() run to completion
 *   lands on the same hyperparameters (1e-12) and the same log marginal
 *   likelihood (1e-9) as psygp_fit(), and desc.refit_every = 5 replayed against
 *   refit_every = 1 on one 78-trial response stream differs by at most
 *   1.7e-4 of probability, which psygp_refit() then erases to 6e-15.
 *
 *   The Laplace log marginal likelihood itself is checked against an
 *   independent dense evaluation of R&W eq. 3.32 (1e-8), which matters
 *   because it is the larger half of what the fit maximizes. The weak priors
 *   are the other half, and a fit that ran away in spite of them still shows
 *   up as a log marginal far closer to zero than the responses allow;
 *   HYPERPARAMETERS says how that looks and what else to do about it.
 *
 *   PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC is checked by the same test, under both links:
 *   the 2N-latent mode satisfies z - mean = K grad log p(y | z) to 4e-8 of
 *   the latent (the Newton tolerance is 1e-8); the predictive mean and
 *   covariance of (m, g) agree with a dense (K2^-1 + W2)^-1 over all 2N
 *   latents to 2e-10 and 2e-9; the Laplace log marginal likelihood agrees
 *   with a dense evaluation through log|K2| + log|K2^-1 + W2| to 1e-8; the
 *   quadrature is checked as MODEL says; the closed-form threshold agrees with
 *   a 40-node quadrature of the crossing to 3e-12; the analytic
 *   hyperparameter gradient agrees with central differences to 2e-8 to 2e-6
 *   over all six hyperparameters under probit and logit, with guess 0.5 and
 *   lapse 0.02, and over all eight with four ordinal outcomes (the mode
 *   converged to 1e-13 for that check, so the differences resolve it); the
 *   look-ahead's cross-covariance between two contexts agrees with the dense
 *   2N posterior to 3e-10, and its rank-one update with a dense update of the
 *   two contexts' joint 4 x 4 covariance to 2e-9; LOCALMI's candidate score
 *   equals its point score to the last bit; ordinal and two-interval sessions
 *   run clean; and on a 2-D observer with a curved threshold and a 7 dB rise
 *   the model's EAVC and LOCALMI find the threshold to 0.7 and 1.0 dB in 80
 *   trials.
 *   On examples/gp_audiometric.c, 20 replications, trial 150: field MAE(p) /
 *   band MAE(p) / threshold error in dB, the worst replication's threshold
 *   error, and ms per trial with fits every 20 trials. semip2 is this model,
 *   PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC, under the example's name for it:

 *
 *   On three of the four cells every semip2 method beats the RBF GP and the
 *   staircase (which is given the psychometric width) on threshold: BALD
 *   0.93 to 1.42 dB, EAVC 1.18 to 1.25, against 2.06 to 2.60 for the
 *   staircase and 1.77 to 2.49 for the RBF GP. The worst replication is 3.1
 *   dB or less there, and 5.9 dB over all four cells, where v0.3.0's was
 *   11.6. Sensory at beta 0.5, a 27 dB climb in two octaves with a 2.6 dB
 *   rise, is the hard cell: there EAVC (1.98 dB) and LOCALMI (2.05) match
 *   the staircase (1.90) and beat both RBF methods, and the per-point
 *   acquisitions do not (2.9 to 3.2). The field error is 3 to 10 times
 *   smaller than the RBF GP's everywhere and already 0.04 to 0.12 at trial
 *   25, against 0.22 to 0.28. The band error is under the RBF GP's at
 *   beta 2 (0.13 to 0.19 against 0.20 to 0.25); at beta 0.5 the band is about
 *   one grid point per column and measures the threshold's location, not the
 *   model's shape, and the staircase given the true width scores 0.32 and
 *   0.54 there. The cost is 8 to 11 ms a trial for the per-point
 *   acquisitions and about 25 for EAVC, against 3 and 7 for the RBF GP.
 *   BALD is the best of the per-point acquisitions on this model and EAVC
 *   the most robust overall.
 *
 *   The async layer of v0.2 is checked by the same test, in a PSYGP_ASYNC
 *   block: a 60-trial session driven through psygp_async_submit() reproduces
 *   the synchronous session bit for bit (memcmp of the history and of the
 *   proposal stream, and the same log marginal likelihood and threshold to the
 *   last bit) with fit_in_idle off; with it on, the log marginal improved in an
 *   idle gap on 27 of 60 trials while the proposals kept up, and
 *   desc.fit_every was parked at 0 for the session and restored at stop; and a
 *   burst that outruns the thread gives PSYGP_ERR_BUSY with nothing copied
 *   (8 accepted, 3 refused, 8 still pending at a stop that drained them). That
 *   test is clean under -fsanitize=thread with no warnings, and the rest of the
 *   test's output is byte-identical between the PSYGP_ASYNC build and the plain
 *   one. examples/gp_async.c runs 200 EAVC trials through a 16 ms frame loop in
 *   11.2 s: with fit_in_idle on and a 225-candidate grid the proposal was ready
 *   by the next frame on 28 trials and late on 172, 2.4 frames of waiting on
 *   average and 5 at worst, the queue never filled, and the threshold at three
 *   contexts came out 0.007 to 0.060 from the truth.
 *
 *   desc.refine_steps is checked there too: the point score it climbs equals
 *   the candidate score to the last bit at every candidate for LSE, BALV,
 *   BALD and LOCALMI, including under CATEGORICAL; every refined proposal stays
 *   within one grid step of the winner it started from and never scores below
 *   it, under all five acquisitions; and the eight LSE streams above give a
 *   mean threshold error of 0.0111 with refine_steps = 2 against 0.0112
 *   without, which on a 65-point grid is what refinement should change: next
 *   to nothing. CANDIDATES has the audiometric numbers, where the grid is
 *   coarse and it matters.
 *
 *   The later additions are checked there as well, and each section says
 *   what it measured: PAIRWISE's trial kernel, mode and predictions against a
 *   dense 2N posterior; the mixed dimension kinds' kernel values, their
 *   analytic lengthscale gradient against differences (2e-5 at worst) and
 *   every proposal on its levels and integers; the monotonic projection
 *   against a brute force through psygp_predict_f(), to the bit; the
 *   conjugate-gradient Newton steps against factoring, to 4e-11; desc.fit_pcg's
 *   fits against the factored fits in lockstep, step by step, to 2e-9; and
 *   132 snapshot resumes against the uninterrupted sessions, byte for byte.
 *
 *   The float build of PSYGP_REAL passes the same test with the tolerances
 *   PRECISION lists, measured rather than assumed, with PSYGP_LIK_GAUSSIAN
 *   rejected at open and its checks skipped. That includes the psychometric
 *   model, whose float mode PRECISION describes, and whose analytic gradient
 *   the float test can check against differences only to 7e-2, since a float
 *   objective is too rough for differences to resolve more; on the 7 dB
 *   observer the float build's threshold error is 0.98 dB against the double
 *   build's 1.12, band error 0.143 against 0.141, same streams.
 *
 *   KNOWN TAILS. The cross-method comparison (tests/compare/methods_compare.py,
 *   streams seeded [20170310, problem, replication]) has no collapsed run
 *   left after v0.5.0, and three single replications that are poor for a
 *   reason the header does not fix:
 *   - csf6 (6-D), GP model, LSE, replication 5: MAE(p) 0.125 and 82 contexts
 *     of 118 with no crossing at trial 300 (0.077 and 57 at trial 500). No
 *     hyperparameter is at a bound (contrast lengthscale 1.35 in 0.075 to 3,
 *     output scale 0.61, mean 0.05). The cause is the problem's numbers: with
 *     guess 0.5 and no lapse, p at the prior mean is 0.75, the target, so in
 *     every context the data have not reached the column crosses or not on
 *     the sign of a mean near 0, and LSE in 6-D leaves most contexts
 *     unreached. Replication 4 of the same method has 25.
 *   - The psychometric model with LSE: metabolic+sensory beta 2 replication
 *     14 (9.5 dB) and older-normal beta 0.5 replication 10 (7.6 dB). The
 *     log-slope output scale is not at its ceiling (0.33 and 0.49 of 10). In
 *     both a fit shortens the threshold GP's frequency lengthscale (3.2 to
 *     0.55 at trial 65; 9.1 to 1.35 at trial 125, after the model had sat at
 *     1.15 dB for 40 trials), the defect-2 jump of the GP model, and LSE then
 *     puts 59 and 49 of its 150 trials in one frequency column. The level-set
 *     guard that stops the jump in the GP model does not run for the
 *     psychometric model; extended to it as a trial, it sees 4.8% of the
 *     candidates flip at the trial-125 fit, under its 5% trigger, so it would
 *     take retuning to one run to catch it, and that was not done. EAVC on
 *     the same streams ends at 0.85 and 0.93 dB.
 *   - The 2-D CSF, GP model, EAVC, replication 12: 7.0 dB. The error is all in
 *     the highest-frequency columns, whose threshold (-5 dB) is at the top of
 *     the box: the posterior mean falls and rises again along intensity there,
 *     and the first crossing is at -42 dB. desc.monotone_dims on the
 *     intensity removes it (1.9 dB); over the 20 replications it takes the
 *     mean threshold error from 1.65 to 1.58 dB and the worst from 6.99 to
 *     2.51, but MAE(p) from 0.086 to 0.092, and five replications get worse
 *     (three by 1 to 1.5 dB), which is why the projection stays opt-in.
 *
 *   COMPARED with AEPsych 0.8.0 through the Python binding, in one process
 *   on one response stream (tests/compare/compare_gp_aepsych.py): the
 *   metabolic phenotype of examples/gp_audiometric.c at beta 2, 10
 *   replications, both libraries given the same Sobol init points. AEPsych
 *   runs its variational GP and its own LSE, EAVC and BALV, optimized over
 *   the box. Threshold error at trial 150, this header's GP model against
 *   AEPsych: EAVC 2.09 against 2.23 dB (inside the replication error), BALV
 *   4.45 against 7.10, LSE 2.06 against 1.29. The LSE gap is the 11 x 21
 *   candidate grid: with refine_steps = 2 LSE reaches 1.44 +- 0.16 dB and
 *   EAVC 1.44 +- 0.28 (CANDIDATES). The field error MAE(p) is about half of
 *   AEPsych's for every acquisition at 100 and 150 trials. The psychometric
 *   model with EAVC reaches 1.26 +- 0.09 dB and a field error of 0.012,
 *   against AEPsych's best of 1.29 dB and 0.18. Fitted from scratch to the
 *   same trials, with AEPsych's output scale fitted (a ScaleKernel) instead
 *   of fixed at 1, the two GP models agree: the fields differ by 0.016 and
 *   the threshold curves by 0.14 dB. The cost per trial is 6 to 13 ms here
 *   against 4 to 8 s for AEPsych, which refits every trial; both ran on one
 *   loaded machine, so the ratio is an order of magnitude, not a number.
 *   On human data (tests/compare/compare_gp_csfdata.py: Letham et al.
 *   2022's 1001-trial 6-D contrast sensitivity set, 5-fold
 *   cross-validation) the held-out log loss is 0.537 to 0.541 for both
 *   models here, 0.529 for AEPsych and 0.543 for logistic regression, all
 *   inside the fold noise. docs/psy_adapt.md,
 *   "Verification", and docs/adapt_comparison.md have the details.
 *
 *   NOT verified: the Laplace band's 95% coverage is unmeasured, and the
 *   categorical one-against-the-rest acquisitions have no Monte Carlo check.
 *   The timings vary by tens of percent between runs of the same binary, so
 *   the frame-budget trial counts are an order of magnitude and not a
 *   specification (examples/gp_bench.c prints its own numbers; MEMORY, COST
 *   AND THREADS quotes them), and the async layer's late counts are a
 *   property of that machine and that grid, not of the header. No
 *   platform other than x86-64 has been built or run. The async layer has run
 *   on Linux (pthreads) and on Windows (MSVC, native threads, and the OS
 *   granted the below-normal drop); psy_rt.h's macOS path is untested here.
 *   gcc 13 has not built this header here: the fix for its
 *   -Wstringop-overflow report at -O3 is by construction (no memcpy takes a
 *   size derived from an int), and clang 18 (zig cc 0.13) builds the test,
 *   the examples and both compile units clean with -Werror.

 *   MODEL
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   A latent field f ~ GP(mean, kernel) over a box [lo, hi] of n_dims
 *   dimensions, observed through one of five likelihoods (desc.lik):
 *
 *     PSYGP_LIK_BERNOULLI   p(y = 1 | f) = link(f), or with a floor and a
 *                           ceiling desc.guess + (1 - guess - lapse)

 *     PSYGP_LIK_ORDINAL     K ordered categories: a confidence rating, a
 *                           Likert scale, "less / same / more".
 *                           p(y = k | f) = link(c_k - f) - link(c_{k-1} - f)
 *                           with K - 1 increasing cutpoints c_1..c_{K-1},
 *                           c_0 = -inf, c_K = +inf. One latent. The
 *                           cutpoints are hyperparameters, fixed in
 *                           desc.hyper.cutpoint or fit; c_1 is pinned to
 *                           0 when fitting, else the mean and the
 *                           cutpoints trade off. AEPsych's
 *                           OrdinalLikelihood.

 *                           K latent GPs sharing one kernel and

 *                           Bernoulli Laplace. Not in AEPsych.
 *     PSYGP_LIK_GAUSSIAN    a continuous y: a matching setting, a
 *                           magnitude estimate, a log reaction time.
 *                           y = f + noise, noise sd a hyperparameter.
 *                           Exact Gaussian posterior, no Newton. AEPsych's

 *                           p = link(f(x1) - f(x2)) (Chu and Ghahramani
 *                           2005), f a latent utility. The likelihood sees
 *                           only the difference d = f(x1) - f(x2), which is
 *                           itself a GP with the four-term kernel
 *                           k(x1,x1') + k(x2,x2') - k(x1,x2') - k(x2,x1'), so
 *                           the inference is the Bernoulli Laplace on an N x N
 *                           matrix, exact Newton, and the utility is
 *                           predicted through the cross kernel
 *                           k(x, x1) - k(x, x2). The mean cancels out of every
 *                           difference, so it is fixed at 0 and not fitted,
 *                           and the utility is identified up to that constant.
 *                           psygp_next_pair() proposes a pair,
 *                           psygp_update_pair() records one, psygp_argmax()
 *                           reports the favorite, psygp_predict_f(.., 0, ..)
 *                           the utility and psygp_predict_pair() P(x1 is
 *                           preferred to x2). psygp_next(), psygp_update(),
 *                           psygp_predict_p() and psygp_threshold() have no
 *                           meaning for a comparison and refuse it, and so
 *                           does the async layer, which submits single
 *                           stimuli. Pair selection: BALD or BALV score the
 *                           comparison between the best stimulus so far and
 *                           each candidate, on d; THOMPSON takes the favorites
 *                           of two posterior draws of the utility; RANDOM and
 *                           the init phase take two Halton points. Measured
 *                           with examples/gp_pairwise.c (a utility peaked at

 *                           comparisons, 12 streams): BALD and Thompson put

 *                           12 streams, and BALV, which maximizes a
 *                           comparison's uncertainty and so spreads its
 *                           pairs, within 0.138, in 3 of 12. 1.5 to 3 ms a

 *
 *   More than one outcome per trial (a detection and a confidence rating, a

 *   taken from whichever handle the design is about or chosen by the caller
 *   from their psygp_acq_score() values. There is no multi-output type:
 *   independent outputs share nothing a joint model would use, and correlated

 *     A two-interval task cannot score below 0.5 and no observer is right
 *     every time, so the built-in links take a floor and a ceiling:
 *
 *       p(y = 1 | f) = guess + (1 - guess - lapse) link(f)
 *
 *     under BERNOULLI, and under ORDINAL the same squeeze on every
 *     cumulative probability P(y >= k), which moves `lapse` of the mass into
 *     the bottom category and `guess` into the top and leaves each category
 *     probability a difference of two squeezed terms. Both default to 0,
 *     both are FIXED (never fitted, they are task structure and not model
 *     slack), and psygp_open() rejects a nonzero value under CATEGORICAL or
 *     GAUSSIAN. Set desc.guess = 0.5 for a two-interval task and the model
 *     no longer has to bend its prior mean to fake the chance level; a lapse
 *     of 0.02 to 0.05 is the usual allowance for attention.
 *     Every level-set quantity follows: the target of the LSE, EAVC and
 *     LOCALMI family and of psygp_threshold() is this same p, so the latent
 *     level is f* = link^-1((target_p - guess) / (1 - guess - lapse)), and
 *     target_p has to lie inside (guess, 1 - lapse) or open() refuses it.
 *     Two costs. First, the log likelihood is no longer log-concave in f
 *     once either is nonzero, so the Laplace posterior is a weaker
 *     approximation: the Newton step clamps a negative Hessian entry to zero
 *     (the treatment R&W give the non-log-concave case) and the line search
 *     guards the step, but the posterior variance at a site the clamp
 *     touched is the prior's, and the approximation degrades as the lapse
 *     grows. Second, a two-interval trial carries less information than a
 *     yes/no trial, and an unregularized hyperparameter fit on a handful of
 *     them can settle on "the whole field is at chance", which is
 *     self-confirming: hyper.mean walks to its lower bound, the output scale
 *     to its lower, the log marginal likelihood sits at N log(guess), and a
 *     level-set acquisition has no gradient left to follow. The remedies are
 *     a longer init phase and a later first fit (n_init 16 and fit_every 20
 *     rather than 8 and 10 for a hundred-trial run), or fixing hyper.mean so
 *     the fit cannot go there.
 *
 *   THE PSYCHOMETRIC MODEL (desc.model = PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC)
 *     Keeley et al. 2023's semiparametric model in its own form, rather than
 *     as the kernel PSYGP_KERNEL_SEMIP approximates it with. Two latent GPs
 *     over the context c (every dimension but intensity_dim): m(c), the
 *     threshold, in intensity units, and g(c), the log of the slope. At a
 *     stimulus (c, x) the latent is
 *
 *       f(c, x) = exp(g(c)) (x - m(c)),     p = link(f)
 *
 *     with the floor and ceiling above, or the ordinal cutpoints on f. Every
 *     slice along the intensity is a psychometric function, increasing by
 *     construction, whose location and steepness vary smoothly with the
 *     context. That is the shape a stationary kernel over the whole box
 *     cannot hold: the RBF latent needs one lengthscale for all of the
 *     intensity axis, so a rise of 7 dB in a 140 dB box comes out tens of dB
 *     wide, and on the audiometric observer the field error inside the
 *     transition band (true p between 0.05 and 0.95) is 0.22 for the RBF GP
 *     and for AEPsych alike. The numbers this model gets are under STATUS.
 *     Priors: m has an RBF-ARD kernel over c with mean hyper.mean (default
 *     the middle of the intensity axis) and output scale hyper.outputscale
 *     (default (span / 4)^2, span the intensity axis's length, i.e. a prior
 *     sd of a quarter of the axis); g has an RBF-ARD kernel with
 *     hyper.lengthscale_g, output scale hyper.outputscale_g (default 0.3) and
 *     mean hyper.mean_g (default log(4 / span): a rise whose probit sd is a
 *     quarter of the axis). With n_dims = 1 there is no context and each GP
 *     is one Gaussian variable, which makes the model a Bayesian parametric
 *     psychometric function.
 *     Inference is Laplace over the 2N latents (m_i, g_i), one pair per
 *     trial, with the prior block-diagonal in (K_m, K_g). The exact Hessian
 *     of log p(y | m, g) is indefinite at every trial with a nonzero residual
 *     (its second-derivative-of-f term has determinant -b^2 l'^2), so the
 *     step uses the Gauss-Newton part J' (-l'') J, J = (-b, f) the gradient
 *     of f, with -l'' clamped at zero as under a floor. That W is positive
 *     semidefinite and rank one per trial, W = U U' with U 2N x N, so every
 *     2N x 2N system collapses to N x N through B = I + U' K U: one Cholesky
 *     per step, the same size as the GP model's. The mode is exact (the
 *     iteration's fixed point is the stationary point of the log posterior)
 *     and W is the curvature the Gaussian takes, which is also what makes the
 *     step converge linearly rather than quadratically: about 10 steps from a
 *     warm start where the GP model takes 2 to 4, to a step of 1e-8 relative.
 *     Exact Newton steps near the mode were tried and measured, solved by
 *     conjugate gradients with the Gauss-Newton posterior as preconditioner:
 *     they halve the steps and the factorizations, but the dropped term is
 *     large enough that the preconditioned solve takes about 10 iterations,
 *     which at N of 50 to 150 costs what the saved factorizations did, and
 *     the whole session came out 1.7 times slower. Gauss-Newton stays.
 *     Prediction at a context is a bivariate Gaussian over (m, g). The
 *     target quantity at an intensity is its expectation over that: m given
 *     g is Gaussian and f is linear in m, so the m integral is the one-latent
 *     machinery (closed form for the probit Bernoulli case) and only g takes
 *     quadrature, PSYGP_QUAD_N = 20 Gauss-Hermite nodes. The test measures
 *     that rule against 60 nodes and against a brute-force rule in both
 *     coordinates: E[q] under the probit agrees to 3e-8 and 2e-8; Var[q],
 *     and under the logit E[q] as well, to about 1e-4, which is the accuracy
 *     of the one-latent 20-node rule in f when the latent sd is several
 *     units and so is the GP model's too.
 *     The threshold at a context is the crossing m + f_t exp(-g), f_t the
 *     latent level of the target, and with (m, g) bivariate Gaussian its
 *     mean and variance are closed form (see ESTIMATES): no scan, no
 *     bisection, and never more than one crossing.
 *     Acquisitions: all six. LSE, BALV and BALD are per point, each computed
 *     by the same quadrature. LSE is the straddle on the probability scale,
 *     beta sd[q] - |E[q] - target_p|, since this latent is not Gaussian and
 *     has no one sd to straddle with. The look-ahead acquisitions work on the
 *     level-set indicator [p > target] = [m + f_t exp(-g) < x], whose
 *     probability is one Gaussian CDF per node of the g quadrature. With W
 *     frozen at the candidate's predictive mean, one more trial there is a
 *     Gauss-Newton site w J J' on that context's (m, g), so it updates every
 *     context's (m, g) posterior by RANK ONE, through
 *     v = Cov((m, g), f*) = Sigma_ij J, and the cross-covariance Sigma_ij
 *     comes from the same L^-1 U' k columns the prediction computes. LOCALMI
 *     is the self-update of the candidate's own context; EAVC is the expected
 *     absolute change in sum_i P(level_i) over the candidates. EAVC keeps
 *     2 M x N of those columns, and a candidate sharing a context with the
 *     one before it shares its update, so on a grid with the intensity
 *     fastest the M^2 pairs cost one context's dot products per column plus
 *     M^2 x outcomes x about 14 Gaussian CDFs (the outer nodes whose weight
 *     is above 1e-12); about 20 ms a trial on the audiometric grid, M = 231.
 *     Under refinement EAVC's point objective is the straddle, as under the
 *     GP model, and LOCALMI is its own.
 *     The hyperparameter gradient is analytic. The explicit terms are the GP
 *     model's with U' dK U inside the trace; the implicit term, through the
 *     mode, needs the TRUE negative Hessian A = K^-1 + W_true, and one adjoint
 *     solve A lambda = d(-1/2 log|B|)/dz serves every hyperparameter. A is
 *     symmetric and positive definite at a maximum, so the solve is
 *     conjugate gradients preconditioned by the Gauss-Newton posterior
 *     K - K U B^-1 U' K, which needs only the factor already in hand, and
 *     K^-1 of each iterate falls out of the same arithmetic, so no
 *     factorization of K and none of a 2N matrix; about 10 iterations of
 *     O(N^2). A breakdown (A not positive definite, so no strict maximum)
 *     falls back to central differences for that one evaluation. Checked
 *     against differences to 1e-6 or better (STATUS). Measured on the
 *     audiometric benchmark with fits every 20 trials, a whole session costs
 *     6 to 9 ms a trial against 3 to 4 ms without fits, so the fits cost 2.7
 *     to 5.7 ms a trial (the difference gradient cost 16 to 20), against 1.2
 *     for the RBF GP: the gap left is the linearly converging mode search,
 *     which every fit evaluation repeats.
 *     desc.refit_every is ignored (every update is an exact refit).
 *     Rejected at open: CATEGORICAL and GAUSSIAN (no psychometric function
 *     of the intensity to write) and PSYGP_KERNEL_SEMIP (the model has its
 *     own GPs).
 *
 *   The header keeps a Gaussian
 *   approximation to the posterior of f given the trials so far, and the
 *   acquisition function picks the next stimulus from a candidate set to
 *   shrink the uncertainty that matters for the question asked. This is
 *   AEPsych's model with two substitutions:
 *
 *     - Inference is the LAPLACE approximation (Williams & Barber 1998;
 *       Rasmussen & Williams 2006 ch. 3): Newton's method to the mode of
 *       the latent posterior, a Gaussian around it. AEPsych uses
 *       variational inference through GPyTorch. Laplace is one Cholesky
 *       per Newton step on an N x N matrix, N being the trial count, and
 *       needs no optimizer. For a probit likelihood on a few hundred
 *       binary trials the two agree to within the noise of the trials
 *       themselves: fitted to the same trials, the two models' fields
 *       differ by 0.016 (STATUS). Laplace underestimates the variance where
 *       the posterior is skewed, that is, early and at the edges;
 *       docs/psy_adapt.md has the caveats.
 *     - The next stimulus is chosen from a CANDIDATE SET, a grid or a
 *       Halton set over the box, not by optimizing the acquisition with
 *       gradients. Every candidate is scored, the best wins; a grid of a
 *       few hundred to a few thousand points is what AEPsych's optimizer
 *       starts from anyway.
 *
 *   KERNELS (desc.kernel)
 *     PSYGP_KERNEL_RBF    squared exponential with one lengthscale per
 *                         dimension (ARD) and an output scale. AEPsych's
 *                         default. Smooth, no assumption of monotonicity.
 *                         k(x, x') = outputscale *
 *                                    exp(-1/2 sum_d ((x_d - x'_d) / l_d)^2),
 *                         so the output scale is a VARIANCE: the prior sd of
 *                         the latent is its square root.
 *     PSYGP_KERNEL_SEMIP  the semiparametric model (Keeley et al. 2023):
 *                         f(c, x) = a(c) + b(c) * x, where x is the
 *                         intensity dimension (desc.intensity_dim) measured
 *                         from the MIDDLE of the box, c the
 *                         other dimensions, and a and b are independent
 *                         RBF GPs over c. Every slice along the intensity
 *                         is a straight line in latent space, i.e. a
 *                         cumulative Gaussian (probit) or logistic (logit)
 *                         psychometric function whose location and slope
 *                         vary smoothly with context. The kernel is
 *                         k_a(c, c') + x x' k_b(c, c'), so it is the same
 *                         Laplace machinery with a different covariance.
 *                         The x of that product is the intensity minus the
 *                         middle of the box, because the slope term's prior
 *                         variance is x^2 k_b(c, c) and the point where the
 *                         slope stops contributing has to be inside the
 *                         stimulus range, not wherever zero falls in the
 *                         caller's units. lengthscale[intensity_dim] is
 *                         unused here, and with n_dims = 1 there is no
 *                         context at all: the model is then plain probit or
 *                         logistic regression with a Gaussian prior on the
 *                         intercept and the slope.
 *                         THE SCALE OF THE INTERCEPT is the trap. a(c) has to
 *                         carry (box middle - threshold) / width of the
 *                         psychometric rise in latent units, so an observer
 *                         whose rise is narrow against the box needs a huge
 *                         intercept: on the audiometric observer of
 *                         examples/gp_audiometric.c, 140 dB of intensity and a
 *                         probit width of 0.5 dB put a(c) over tens of latent
 *                         units and its output scale over a thousand, where
 *                         the default ceiling is 10 and the weak prior of
 *                         HYPERPARAMETERS is centered on 1. Measured there
 *                         with the level-set acquisition, 20 replications of
 *                         150 trials: 8.97 dB of threshold error with the
 *                         prior, 7.07 dB without it, 6.10 dB without it and
 *                         with the two output-scale ceilings raised to 4000
 *                         and 100, against 1.98 dB for the plain RBF kernel on
 *                         the same observer. So the semiparametric kernel is
 *                         the wrong model for that combination, not a badly
 *                         fitted one, and the way to use it on a steep
 *                         observer is to scale the intensity axis so the
 *                         psychometric rise is of order 1 (which puts the
 *                         intercept in range), or to set hyper_max and
 *                         desc.no_hyper_prior for the scale the problem needs.
 *                         Keeley's slope is constrained positive; this
 *                         kernel's is not, and a run with too few trials at
 *                         one context can put a negative slope there. The
 *                         HYPERPARAMETERS and ESTIMATES sections say how
 *                         to see it. PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC (MODEL) is
 *                         the positive-slope form, with the threshold as a
 *                         GP of its own, so no intercept has to carry the
 *                         threshold's distance from the box middle. This
 *                         kernel is kept as it was, for reproducibility.
 *                         Under CATEGORICAL each latent gets its own a and
 *                         b.
 *   DIMENSION KINDS (desc.dim_kind, desc.dim_levels)
 *     Every dimension is PSYGP_DIM_CONTINUOUS unless desc.dim_kind says
 *     otherwise, and the intensity dimension always is.
 *     PSYGP_DIM_INTEGER     the integers in [lo, hi] (lo and hi must be
 *                           integers): a count of repetitions, a number of
 *                           tones. The kernel is the RBF term on the
 *                           coordinates rounded to the nearest integer, so a
 *                           prediction at 1.2 is the prediction at 1.
 *     PSYGP_DIM_CATEGORICAL dim_levels unordered levels, coded 0 .. levels - 1
 *                           with the box [0, levels - 1]: a talker, a masker
 *                           type, an ear. Its kernel factor is
 *                           exp(-(1 - delta) / l), 1 for the same level and
 *                           exp(-1 / l) for any two different ones, so every
 *                           level borrows from every other through the one
 *                           fitted l: large l, the levels behave alike; small
 *                           l, each is its own function. No order is implied,
 *                           which is the difference from coding the levels as
 *                           a CONTINUOUS axis, where level 0 and level 2 are
 *                           further apart than 0 and 1 whatever the data say.
 *                           Its lengthscale's start, bounds and prior are
 *                           those of a span of 4: prior center and start 1
 *                           (two levels correlated e^-1 = 0.37), bounds 0.2
 *                           to 8 (0.007 to 0.88).
 *     The kinds multiply into both kernels (a categorical context of SEMIP's
 *     intercept and slope GPs, of the psychometric model's threshold and
 *     slope GPs) and into the analytic hyperparameter gradient. Candidates
 *     honor them: a product grid enumerates a CATEGORICAL dimension's levels
 *     (its grid[d] is 0 or the level count) and rounds an INTEGER one (grid[d]
 *     at most the number of integers); Halton points, the init phase and
 *     RANDOM draw integers and levels with equal shares; a caller's candidate
 *     set must already hold them. Refinement (CANDIDATES) scores every level
 *     of a CATEGORICAL dimension and every integer within one candidate
 *     spacing (at least the two neighbors) of an INTEGER one, instead of the
 *     golden section. psygp_update() stores the rounded coordinates, and
 *     psygp_threshold() rounds its context. Measured with the field of
 *     test_mixed in tests/adapt/psy_gp_test.c (a 3-level context whose middle
 *     level is the far one, an integer context 0 to 4, threshold RMSE over the
 *     15 cells, LSE on a 21 x 3 x 5 grid with refine_steps 2, 20 streams):
 *
 *       trials                          45       80      120
 *       GP, kinds                     0.041    0.024    0.024
 *       GP, both contexts CONTINUOUS  0.066    0.047    0.035
 *       psychometric model, kinds     0.046    0.025    0.022
 *
 *     The kinds cost 0.6 to 3.0 ms a trial against 0.4 to 2.2 for the same
 *     sessions as CONTINUOUS: the per-dimension kernel term is a branch
 *     instead of a multiply. A description with every dimension CONTINUOUS
 *     takes the old code path and gives the old results to the bit.
 *
 *   MONOTONIC PROJECTION (desc.monotone_dims)
 *     Neither kernel knows that p rises with the intensity, and on a sparse
 *     or noisy run the GP model's posterior mean can fall along it; the
 *     threshold search then takes the first crossing and says there was more
 *     than one (psygp_threshold_multi_cross()). Bit d of
 *     desc.monotone_dims (increasing) replaces the posterior mean at x with
 *     its largest value over the points below x on the candidate line through
 *     x along dimension d (every masked dimension's line at once, their
 *     product, when several are set), x included. That is AEPsych's
 *     MonotonicProjectionGP. The line is the product grid's own when there is
 *     one, and otherwise as many evenly spaced points as M candidates would
 *     have along one side of a grid, 9 to 65. psygp_predict_p(),
 *     psygp_predict_p_many(), psygp_predict_p_var(), psygp_threshold() (and
 *     so desc.stop_threshold_sd) and the level-set acquisitions LSE, EAVC and
 *     LOCALMI read the projected mean; psygp_predict_f() and
 *     psygp_predict_f_many() still report the latent posterior, and BALV,
 *     BALD and the optimization acquisitions are unchanged.
 *     It is a projection of the MEAN, not a constraint on the posterior: the
 *     variance, the Laplace mode, the hyperparameter fit and the look-ahead
 *     covariance are what they would be without it. Two consequences the test
 *     measures: the projected mean never falls from one line point to the
 *     next, but between two line points it can fall by as much as the
 *     unprojected mean does inside one spacing; and E[p], which also depends

 *     GP model only, one latent: not with PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC (monotone

 *     CATEGORICAL dimension. Cost: a projected prediction is a posterior mean,
 *     one kernel row and a dot product, at every line point below x, at most
 *     65 of them per masked dimension; on a product grid the acquisition

 *     The projection helps LSE most (13% less threshold error at trial 150,
 *     17% at trial 25), because its straddle reads the mean directly and a
 *     dip in the mean is a false level-set crossing it will sample. EAVC gains
 *     3 to 11% from trial 50 on and nothing before. BALD's proposals do not
 *     read the mean, so its thresholds are unchanged and only the reported
 *     field improves, by up to 4%. The price is a few more fits at the
 *     output-scale ceiling (2 and 5 runs of 80 for lse-mono and eavc-mono
 *     against 0 and 1) and, under EAVC, about 8% more time a trial.
 *
 *   HYPERPARAMETERS (desc.hyper, desc.fit)
 *     lengthscale[d], outputscale and mean for RBF; a second lengthscale
 *     set and outputscale for the slope GP under SEMIP; cutpoint[k] under
 *     ORDINAL; noise_sd under GAUSSIAN. Under PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC,
 *     lengthscale, outputscale and mean are the threshold GP m's (the output
 *     scale in squared intensity units, the mean in intensity units) and
 *     lengthscale_g, outputscale_g and mean_g the log-slope GP g's; MODEL has
 *     their defaults, and lengthscale[intensity_dim] is unused.
 *     A NONZERO field is fixed at that
 *     value. A zero field takes a default and is the set psygp_fit() fits:
 *     lengthscale (hi - lo) / 4, outputscale 1, mean 0, cutpoints 0, 1, 2,
 *     ... (c_1 is pinned to 0 while they are fitted, so the mean stays
 *     identifiable), noise_sd 0.1. Two consequences of "zero means fit":
 *     the mean cannot be pinned to exactly 0 while it is being fitted (set
 *     it to 1e-12, or leave desc.fit off), and setting cutpoint[0] fixes
 *     the whole cutpoint vector. A fixed mean is how the prior is centered
 *     somewhere other than p = 0.5: link^-1(p0), e.g. -1.28 for p0 = 0.1 in
 *     a yes/no task with rare false alarms.
 *     Fitting maximizes the log marginal likelihood plus the weak priors
 *     below: the Laplace
 *     approximation to it (R&W eq. 3.32) for the discrete likelihoods,
 *     the exact one (R&W eq. 2.30) for GAUSSIAN. The GRADIENT is analytic
 *     (R&W eqs. 5.22 to 5.24 for Laplace, including the implicit term
 *     through the mode; eq. 5.9 for Gaussian), so a fit is gradient ascent
 *     with a backtracking line search, bounded by [hyper_min, hyper_max],
 *     from the values in force. Lengthscales, output scales, cutpoint gaps
 *     and the noise are fitted as logarithms, the mean as itself. Bounds
 *     default to 0.05 (hi - lo) to 2 (hi - lo) for a lengthscale, 0.1 to 10
 *     for an output scale, -5 to +5 for the mean, 0.01 to 10 for a cutpoint
 *     gap and 1e-3 to 10 for the noise sd; a zero bound field means the
 *     default, so a bound of exactly zero cannot be asked for.
 *     One objective-plus-gradient evaluation is one Laplace refit plus
 *     O(N^2) per hyperparameter, and a fit stops after desc.fit_max_evals of
 *     them (0 = 40), when no gradient component exceeds desc.fit_tol (0 =
 *     1e-8, in objective units per unit of the fitted coordinate, which is
 *     the logarithm for a scale), or when no uphill step is left.
 *     psygp_fit() returns 1 when it stopped for one of the last two reasons
 *     and 0 when the budget ran out (or a guard below undid it), and
 *     psygp_fit_delta() is the objective's change. The budget is small on
 *     purpose, because a scheduled fit runs inside the trial loop, and on a
 *     large data set it does not converge: on Letham et al.'s 6-D contrast
 *     sensitivity data (tests/compare/compare_gp_csfdata.py, 500-trial
 *     subsets) one psygp_fit() never did, and it took about 3 repeated
 *     fits for the GP model and 7 for the psychometric model, whose
 *     lengthscales drift along a flat ridge, before the log marginal moved by
 *     less than 1e-3 nats. For an analysis rather than a session, call
 *     psygp_fit() until it returns 1 or psygp_fit_delta() is below the
 *     change you care about, or raise desc.fit_max_evals. A psygp_fit() that
 *     follows one the budget stopped keeps that fit's step length instead of
 *     starting again at a quarter of the gradient, which is what lets a
 *     repeated small budget make progress: in the test, a 4-evaluation fit
 *     repeated reaches the hyperparameters one 48-evaluation fit reaches, where
 *     restarting the step left it stuck after three rounds. A scheduled fit
 *     always starts afresh, as before. The step is
 *     monotone: a fit never leaves the
 *     model with a lower objective than it started with, and since v0.5.0
 *     that is checked rather than assumed: psygp_fit() and a scheduled fit
 *     compare the objective after the fit with the one before and undo the
 *     fit if it is worse or not finite, and a restore inside the ascent that
 *     does not come back to the value its point was accepted at is refitted
 *     from the prior mean. The mode search enforces its own half: the mode
 *     maximizes Psi, so a result that is not finite or scores below Psi at
 *     the prior mean is not the mode, and the search restarts from the prior
 *     mean, and returns PSYGP_ERR_NUMERIC if that fails too. Both were missing
 *     until the cross-method comparison found a psychometric-model fit that
 *     restored its accepted point from a rejected point's mode, where the
 *     Gauss-Newton search ran into its step cap on a plateau of saturated
 *     links and reported success with a log marginal likelihood of -1e49
 *     (tests/adapt/psy_gp_test.c replays the recorded trials).
 *     CATEGORICAL is the exception: its gradient is central differences on
 *     the same objective (2 P + 1 refits per gradient), because the
 *     implicit term of eq. 5.23 needs third derivatives of a coupled block
 *     Hessian. It is correct but slow, and it is the one part of the fit
 *     that is not analytic.
 *
 *     WEAK PRIORS (desc.priors, desc.no_hyper_prior). Every prior parameter
 *     is a field of desc.priors, a psygp_prior {center, sd, ceiling} per
 *     hyperparameter; zero means the default in this table, a negative sd
 *     turns that one prior off, desc.no_hyper_prior turns them all off, and
 *     psygp_get_priors() reports what is in force with the defaults filled
 *     in. The defaults, and where each was measured:
 *
 *       lengthscale    log-normal, center 0.25 (hi - lo) of its dimension,
 *                      sd 1 in the log. The 1-D and audiometric observers
 *                      of v0.1 (below).
 *       outputscale    log-normal, center 1, sd 0.7; under PSYCHOMETRIC the
 *                      threshold GP's, center (span / 4)^2. v0.1 below, and
 *                      the center-at-1 comparison against a box on [1, 4].
 *       outputscale_b  SEMIP's slope GP, as outputscale. v0.1.
 *       outputscale_g  PSYCHOMETRIC's log-slope GP, center 0.3, sd 0.7. The
 *                      sensory tail of v0.4.0 (below).
 *       mean           the GP model's mean on a discrete likelihood, normal,
 *                      center 0, sd 0.7. The novel discrimination function
 *                      of v0.5.0 (below), and a floor that swallows the
 *                      mean: with guess = 0.5, a first fit on data at the
 *                      floor rate (5 yes of 10 on the 6-D contrast
 *                      sensitivity problem, csf6 replication 4 of
 *                      tests/compare/methods_compare.py) has its likelihood
 *                      maximum at p = 0.5 everywhere, mean at its lower
 *                      bound, where the gradient in the mean vanishes;
 *                      v0.4.1 stayed there for 300 trials, log marginal
 *                      300 ln 0.5. With the prior the mean is -0.52 at
 *                      trial 10 and p spans 0.65 to 0.69; the test replays
 *                      those trials with and without it. Starting the mean
 *                      from the observed yes rate would not help: a rate at
 *                      the floor maps to a latent of minus infinity.
 *       mean_g         PSYCHOMETRIC's mean log-slope, normal in the log,
 *                      center a rise of 0.25 of the intensity axis, sd 1,
 *                      ceiling a rise of 1/256 of it. The runaway of v0.3.0
 *                      and the slope study of v0.4.1 (below).
 *       noise_sd       GAUSSIAN's noise, off unless center and sd are set.
 *
 *     The rise fractions of mean_g are the axis span over the slope's
 *     reciprocal: a center of 0.1 is a prior slope of 10 / span. Changing any
 *     of these changes a fit, so the numbers in this manual hold at the
 *     defaults only.
 *     AEPsych puts gamma priors on the
 *     lengthscales and optimizes the variational ELBO with autodiff. This is
 *     the same gradient by hand, with priors of the same purpose:
 *     log-normal on every lengthscale, centered on the default (hi - lo) / 4
 *     with an sd of 1 in logarithms, and log-normal on the output scales,
 *     centered at 1 with an sd of 0.7. Since v0.5.0 the GP model's mean has
 *     one too, on the discrete likelihoods: normal, centered at 0 (p = 0.5,
 *     or the middle of the floor and ceiling), sd 0.7. Nothing on GAUSSIAN's
 *     mean, which is in the caller's units, or on the cutpoints.
 *     The mean is where the field goes far from every trial, and a run whose
 *     responses are mostly one way sent it to its bound of 5 with nothing to
 *     stop it: on AEPsych's novel discrimination function (p has a floor of
 *     0.5 at the bottom edge and rises steeply, so most responses are yes) the
 *     model then called the whole box above the 0.75 level and most columns
 *     lost their crossing. Measured with 100 replications of 150 EAVC trials
 *     (the sd, then columns of 30 with no crossing, runs with more than half
 *     missing, threshold error, fitted mean): none, 21.9, 81, 0.081, 3.33;
 *     2, 19.7, 70, 0.083, 2.51; 1, 5.9, 17, 0.062, 1.20; 0.7, 2.7, 7, 0.054,
 *     0.63; 0.5, 2.9, 5, 0.052, 0.33. Under LSE the same five give 3.0, 1.4
 *     and 0.3 to 0.7 columns. 0.7 is the default, and on
 *     tests/compare/methods_compare.py's eleven 2-D problems (the eight
 *     audiograms, novel detection and discrimination, the CSF), 20
 *     replications each, it changes no GP threshold error by more than the
 *     spread between replications except novel discrimination under EAVC,
 *     from 21.9 columns without a crossing to 1.2, and the CSF, from 1.5 to
 *     1.9 such columns to 0.1 to 0.9.
 *     Under PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC the threshold GP's output-scale prior is
 *     centered on its default, (span / 4)^2, and the mean log-slope mean_g has
 *     a normal prior of its own, centered on its default log(4 / span) with an
 *     sd of 1. That one is not optional in practice: separable early
 *     responses favor an infinitely steep psychometric function exactly as
 *     they favor an infinite output scale, and a step is worse than useless
 *     to this model, because every trial then sits in the flat tail of the
 *     link, adds no curvature, and leaves the Laplace posterior of the
 *     threshold where it was, so a level-set acquisition asks the same
 *     question forever. Without it, on a 2-D observer with a 7 dB rise over
 *     a 100 dB axis, mean_g ran to its ceiling at trial 5 and the log
 *     marginal likelihood to 0.00; with an sd of 1.5 two LSE runs in five
 *     still ran away (threshold error 3.3 dB on average); with 1.0 or 0.5 none
 *     did (0.9 and 1.1 dB under LSE, 1.5 and 0.8 under BALV, five streams
 *     each), and 1.0 leaves the data more room to move the slope. mean_g is
 *     bounded to [log(0.25 / span), log(256 / span)] and mean to the
 *     intensity axis.
 *     The log-slope GP's output-scale prior is centered at 0.3, not 1 (sd 0.7
 *     in the logarithm, as for the others, default 0.3, lower bound 0.01).
 *     In psychophysics a slope varies across a context by tens of percent,
 *     not by factors of four, and a slope GP free to vary that much has a way
 *     out that the threshold GP does not: where the threshold climbs fast,
 *     it can flatten the rise instead of following the climb, and the 75%
 *     point then lands tens of dB off. That was the 7 to 12 dB tail on the
 *     audiometric sensory phenotype. Measured with examples/gp_audiometric.c,
 *     20 replications, trial 150, threshold error in dB (worst replication)
 *     and band MAE(p), for the center at 1, 0.5 and 0.3:
 *

 *     The threshold GP's lengthscale ended over 3 octaves in 0 to 5 runs of 20
 *     on sensory at every center and in 17 to 20 of 20 on metabolic.
 *     So 0.3 removes the tail (worst replication 5.6 dB, from 11.6) and costs
 *     metabolic nothing outside its interval; it is also better on the 2-D
 *     observer of the test (LSE 0.98 to 0.72 dB, BALV 1.07 to 0.75, 20
 *     streams) and within noise on the 1-D observers. The cost is sensory at
 *     beta 0.5 under BALV, 2.03 to 3.26 dB. 0.5 is worse than either: its
 *     one bad replication is 26 dB. The lengthscale count shows that a long
 *     threshold lengthscale is NOT the mechanism, contrary to a diagnosis
 *     from one dumped replication: it is the rule on metabolic, whose
 *     threshold really is smooth, and rare on sensory at every center.
 *
 *     THE FITTED MEAN SLOPE IS LOW, AND ITS PRIOR STAYS. On the audiometric
 *     observer exp(mean_g) comes out at about half the true slope (0.24 to
 *     0.30 per dB against 0.5 at beta 2), and it is the mean_g prior that puts
 *     it there, not the Laplace approximation. Measured on one metabolic
 *     beta 2 replication, with every other hyperparameter at its fitted
 *     value: the Laplace log marginal likelihood alone peaks at a slope of
 *     0.51 per dB, the truth, and so does the same marginal with the true
 *     Hessian in place of the Gauss-Newton one (they differ by 0.1 nats at
 *     the peak and at most 1.1 on the shallow side); the prior costs 1.9
 *     nats between 0.24 and 0.51 per dB, which moves the objective's maximum
 *     to 0.24, the fitted value, where the analytic gradient is -2e-3.
 *     Tightening the mode to 1e-13 moves the fitted mean_g by 4e-4.
 *     Loosening the prior was measured, and it is the wrong fix. 20
 *     replications on each of metabolic and sensory at beta 2 and 0.5, trial
 *     150, pooled over the four cells; the slope ratio is exp(mean_g) over the
 *     true slope, the band is MAE(p) where the true p is in [0.05, 0.95] on a
 *     30 x 300 grid, and each threshold is the mean error in dB (worst

 *     (The center is the rise the prior expects, as a fraction of the
 *     intensity axis; 1/4 is the default.) Every setting that lifts the
 *     slope ratio above 0.6 reopens the tail under LSE, worst replications
 *     of 7 to 18 dB; BALV is indifferent to the prior; and the band error
 *     does not move at all. The 2-D observer of the test agrees: at 1/4, sd 1
 *     it gets 0.72, 0.75 and 0.60 dB under LSE, BALV and EAVC with a band of
 *     0.07 to 0.09, and every looser setting makes LSE 1.9 to 3.0 dB with a
 *     band of 0.14 to 0.20, while the slope under LSE and EAVC OVERSHOOTS the
 *     truth (0.5 to 1.0 per dB against 0.37). The mechanism is the one the
 *     prior was introduced for: a level-set acquisition puts its trials at
 *     the threshold, where the slope is poorly identified, and a fit with room
 *     to steepen does, into the flat tail where trials stop informing the
 *     threshold. BALV, which spreads its trials, recovers the slope at any
 *     setting (0.33 to 0.43 per dB on the 2-D observer against 0.37). The
 *     early runaway itself stayed rare everywhere: at most 5 runs of 20 had
 *     mean_g at its ceiling or the log marginal above -2 by trial 25, and
 *     then only at 1/20 with sd 2.
 *     Nor is the slope what holds the band error. A model with the exact
 *     slope and a threshold off by the 1.1 to 1.3 dB this one is off by
 *     would score a band MAE of 0.15 to 0.17 at beta 2, which is what it
 *     scores; at beta 0.5 an exact slope with a 1.4 dB threshold error would
 *     score 0.48, and this model scores 0.26 to 0.31, because the posterior
 *     mean of p averages over the threshold's uncertainty and is correctly
 *     shallower than any one psychometric function. Per replication the band
 *     error tracks the threshold error (correlation 0.46 to 0.93). The band is
 *     a threshold-location metric at these widths, and the way to lower it is
 *     a better threshold. desc.priors.mean_g sets the center, the sd and the
 *     ceiling for that kind of measurement, and a desc.hyper.mean_g fixed at
 *     the true slope's logarithm is the way to use a slope known in
 *     advance.
 *     They are what stops the fit from interpolating its own trials. Type-II
 *     maximum likelihood on a run whose responses nearly separate keeps
 *     improving as the output scale grows and the lengthscale shrinks, so it
 *     ends at whatever bound it hits; the posterior is then diffuse or
 *     interpolating, and a level-set acquisition follows the variance to the
 *     edges of the box instead of the threshold. The likelihood is flat near
 *     that bound, so a prior this weak moves the answer a long way there and
 *     hardly at all once the data have something to say.
 *     What it bought, measured by examples/gp_audiometric.c on the metabolic
 *     phenotype at beta = 2 over 20 replications of 150 trials with the
 *     level-set acquisition (the same seeds, priors off then on): the
 *     threshold error at trial 150 fell from 3.14 +- 0.30 dB to
 *     1.98 +- 0.32 dB and the surface error from 0.115 to 0.077, the output
 *     scale stopped sitting on its upper bound (20 runs out of 20 before,
 *     none after), and the Laplace log marginal likelihood went from -20.6 to
 *     -58.7 nats, where 150 binary trials at a 75% level cannot honestly beat
 *     about -84. The early surface error is the one thing that got worse
 *     (0.153 to 0.256 at trial 25): a conservative fit starts further from
 *     the truth and ends closer. On the 1-D observer of the STATUS block the
 *     priors cut the mean absolute threshold error of LSE from 0.050 to 0.011
 *     and of BALD from 0.043 to 0.037 over eight streams.
 *     desc.no_hyper_prior turns them off and fits type-II maximum likelihood,
 *     which is what the numbers above call the "before".
 *
 *     WHERE THE OUTPUT-SCALE PRIOR IS CENTERED, and why it stays at 1. A
 *     same-data comparison with AEPsych showed its model ahead early (field
 *     MAE(p) 0.144 against 0.233 at trial 25) and level late, and AEPsych puts
 *     a smoothed box on [1, 4] on the output scale. Three priors were run on
 *     the same seeds: the log-normal centered at 1 (this header's), the same
 *     centered at 3, and a smoothed box on [1, 4] (flat inside, Gaussian tails
 *     of sd 0.05 in the logarithm). First examples/gp_audiometric.c, metabolic
 *     phenotype, beta = 2, 20 replications; each cell is field MAE(p) /
 *     threshold error in dB / mean fitted output scale:
 *
 *       trial              25              50             100             150
 *       LSE  center 1  .256 6.8 1.3  .163 3.7 2.1  .120 2.2 3.1  .077 2.0 6.4

 *
 *     then the 1-D observer of the STATUS block, 20 streams of 150 trials,
 *     field MAE(p) / threshold error / output scale:
 *
 *       trial                  25                  150
 *       LSE  center 1   .120 .035 1.4    .058 .014 1.9
 *            center 3   .086 .040 3.7    .055 .016 4.2
 *            box 1-4    .087 .035 3.8    .043 .014 4.0
 *       EAVC center 1   .117 .033 1.4    .069 .010 1.9
 *            center 3   .088 .028 3.6    .050 .013 4.1
 *            box 1-4    .086 .023 3.7    .049 .013 4.0
 *
 *     Early, the lead is real: at trial 25 either alternative cuts the field
 *     error by about a third on both observers. Late, the three split.
 *     Centered at 3, the prior lets the output scale run to its upper bound
 *     of 10 (39 of 40 audiometric runs end on it, against 1 of 40 centered at
 *     1) and the late threshold is the worst of the three: that is the
 *     runaway the prior exists to stop. The box is not really a prior on
 *     these data: every fit on both observers ends at 4.00 to 4.06, its upper
 *     edge, so it acts as an output scale fixed at 4. Fixing it at 4 outright
 *     (desc.hyper.outputscale = 4) reproduces the box's field errors to within
 *     0.01 at every trial count on the audiometric observer, but not its late
 *     LSE threshold (2.00 against the box's 1.66 dB, both intervals about
 *     +- 0.3), which says that one number is seed noise. What the box
 *     reliably does is trade a better early field (and a better late field on
 *     the steep 1-D observer) for a worse late field on the audiometric one
 *     (0.088 against 0.077 for LSE, 0.069 against 0.058 for EAVC), where the
 *     data want an output scale of 6 to 7 by trial 150 and the box will not
 *     let them. Late accuracy is the tie-breaker, and it splits between the
 *     two observers, so it does not justify a change: the default stays
 *     centered at 1, where the rest of the manual's numbers were measured.
 *     A session that cares more about its early
 *     estimate can have the box's behavior by fixing desc.hyper.outputscale
 *     at 4. Bounds of [1, 4] on the fitted scale do not do it: the log-normal
 *     keeps the fit on the lower edge early (1.3 at trial 25, measured) and
 *     only the ceiling is ever reached.
 *     The fit therefore maximizes a posterior, not a likelihood.
 *     psygp_log_marginal() still reports the likelihood alone, and the
 *     symptom of a fit that ran away anyway is a log marginal much closer
 *     to zero than the responses allow: a hundred binary trials at a 75%
 *     level cannot be explained better than about -56 nats, so a fit
 *     reporting -5 has interpolated, and its threshold band will be wide and
 *     its threshold estimate unreliable. What is left to do about that is to
 *     raise hyper_min.lengthscale, lower hyper_max.outputscale, or fix the
 *     mean.
 *     A lengthscale at its UPPER bound, on the other hand, is usually not a
 *     complaint: a field that really is flat along a dimension wants an
 *     infinite lengthscale there, and the bound is the only thing stopping
 *     it. On the audiometric observer's flat phenotype the frequency
 *     lengthscale sat on its ceiling in 15 to 20 runs out of 20 with no cost
 *     to either metric. Read it as "this dimension carries no structure",
 *     and only worry when the field plainly does vary along it.
 *     Fits run every desc.fit_every trials once the init phase is over and
 *     on psygp_fit(). Log psygp_get_hyper() with your data: a lengthscale
 *     that hits its bound is a warning, a slope output scale that hits
 *     its upper bound under SEMIP is the negative-slope case above.
 *     A whole fit is one call and tens of refits, which is more than an
 *     inter-trial interval holds. psygp_fit_step() is the same ascent one
 *     evaluation at a time: it returns 1 while another step would help, 0
 *     when it is done, and leaves the best hyperparameters found so far in
 *     force every time it returns, so the caller can spend one step per
 *     trial and read estimates in between. Recording a trial throws the
 *     stepping state away, since the data it was fitting have changed; a
 *     caller that wants to interleave fitting with trials should run the
 *     steps to 0 in the gaps of one trial, or accept that a long fit
 *     restarts. psygp_fit() is a loop over psygp_fit_step().
 *
 *   ACQUISITION (desc.acq)
 *     The first desc.n_init trials are a Halton sequence over the box
 *     (AEPsych's Sobol phase; Halton because it is ten lines and
 *     deterministic). After that the candidates are scored and the best
 *     wins. The level-set family (LSE, EAVC, LOCALMI) needs a TARGET, and
 *     psygp_open() rejects a desc without one: for BERNOULLI the level
 *     P(y = 1) = target_p; for ORDINAL P(y >= target_outcome) = target_p;
 *     for CATEGORICAL P(y = target_outcome) = target_p; for GAUSSIAN
 *     E[y] = target_value. f* below is the latent value that meets it, the
 *     level of the latent field itself and not of its posterior average.
 *     Note that PSYGP_ACQ_LSE is the default acq, so a zeroed desc needs a
 *     target_p even when the level set is not what is wanted; BALV, BALD
 *     and RANDOM need none.
 *
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_LSE      level-set straddle (Bryan et al. 2005; Gotovos
 *                        et al. 2013; AEPsych "LevelSetEstimation"):
 *                        beta * sd_f(x) - |mean_f(x) - f*|. Cheap, myopic,
 *                        and drawn to the edges of the box. beta =
 *                        desc.acq_beta, default 1.96 (AEPsych's 3.84 is on
 *                        the variance and is the same number).
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_EAVC     expected absolute volume change of the level set
 *                        (Letham et al. 2022; AEPsych "EAVC"): the
 *                        candidate whose outcome is expected to move the
 *                        most of the box across the target. The one
 *                        AEPsych's authors recommend for thresholds, and
 *                        this header's recommendation. Needs the LOOK-AHEAD
 *                        below. The volume is sum over candidates of
 *                        P(f(x) > f*), the expected NUMBER of candidates in
 *                        the level set, so the score is continuous in every
 *                        candidate's mean and variance; the score of a
 *                        candidate is E_y |volume - volume after y|.
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_LOCALMI  mutual information between the outcome at x and
 *                        the level-set membership of x, the Bernoulli
 *                        1{f(x) > f*} (Letham et al. 2022; AEPsych
 *                        "LocalMI"). Look-ahead, but only at the candidate
 *                        itself, so it needs no M x M covariance and costs
 *                        one quadrature per candidate.
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_BALV     posterior variance of the target probability, or
 *                        of E[y] under GAUSSIAN (AEPsych
 *                        "MCPosteriorVariance"): global estimation of the
 *                        whole field.
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_BALD     mutual information between the outcome and f
 *                        (Houlsby et al. 2011; AEPsych
 *                        "BernoulliMCMutualInformation"): global, and less
 *                        drawn to the edges than BALV. Defined for every
 *                        likelihood.
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_RANDOM   Halton for every trial, or draws from desc.rng
 *                        when it is set. A baseline for a simulation, or a
 *                        space-filling schedule you want reproducible. The
 *                        point is not a candidate (psygp_next() returns -1);
 *                        under psygp_next_subset() it is the subset
 *                        candidate nearest the drawn point.
 *
 *     OPTIMIZATION: "find the stimulus the observer rates highest" rather
 *     than a level set. q is the target quantity (P(y = 1), P(y >= k*),
 *     one-against-the-rest P(y = k*), or E[y] under GAUSSIAN), maximized, or
 *     minimized under desc.minimize; target_p is not needed.
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_UCB      E[q] + acq_beta sd[q] (1.96 by default).
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_EI       E[max(q - best, 0)], the expected improvement over
 *                        the best posterior mean of q at a stimulus already
 *                        tried (the posterior mean, since a binary outcome is
 *                        not the quantity being optimized). Closed form under
 *                        GAUSSIAN, quadrature over f otherwise.
 *     PSYGP_ACQ_THOMPSON one joint draw of the latent at every candidate from
 *                        the M x M posterior covariance the look-ahead builds,
 *                        and the argmax of the draw's q. Needs desc.rng, for
 *                        the normal variates; GP model only; never refined,
 *                        since a draw has no value between candidates. Under
 *                        CATEGORICAL only the target class is drawn.
 *     psygp_argmax() then reports the stimulus with the best posterior mean
 *     of q. The repeat guard below does not apply to these three (returning
 *     to the optimum is the point); the flat test does. Measured with
 *     examples/gp_optimize.c on a 2-D bump, 80 trials, 12 streams: under
 *     GAUSSIAN all three put the argmax within 0.02 of the maximum by trial
 *     20 and within 0.01 by trial 50 (Thompson best, 0.006 at trial 80), in
 *     12 of 12 streams; under BERNOULLI, with the bump covering a tenth of
 *     the box and p = 0.02 outside it, UCB finds it in 8 of 12, EI in 7 and
 *     Thompson in 9. A stream that misses is one whose first trials all
 *     answer 0: the model then sees a flat field, UCB spends its trials at
 *     the box corners, where the latent sd is largest and a tail observation
 *     shrinks it slowly, and EI has nothing to improve on; a longer init
 *     phase is the remedy. Cost per trial at N = 80, M = 441: UCB and EI 1 to
 *     1.7 ms, Thompson 10 to 11 (the M x M covariance and its Cholesky).
 *
 *     Expectations over one latent are Gauss-Hermite quadrature with
 *     PSYGP_QUAD_N (20) nodes. Under CATEGORICAL the latents are coupled
 *     by the softmax, and BALV, BALD and the look-aheads score each class
 *     latent one-against-the-rest (its mean minus the log-sum-exp of the
 *     other class means, through a logistic link) and sum; that is an
 *     approximation, and the manual says so here so the comparison against
 *     a Monte Carlo score (which desc.rng makes possible, see
 *     docs/psy_adapt.md) is not a surprise. The look-ahead covariance under
 *     CATEGORICAL drops the between-class term of R&W eq. 3.41 as well.
 *     Ties break toward the lowest candidate index, unless desc.rng is set,
 *     in which case a tie is a draw. Two scores tie when they are within
 *     1e-12 of the best, relative.
 *     TWO DEGENERACIES, and the guard against them. A posterior so diffuse
 *     that every candidate scores alike, and a posterior so confident that
 *     one candidate wins forever, both stop a run from learning: the first
 *     hands every trial to the lowest index, the second to the same index.
 *     psygp_next() therefore falls back to a Halton point (returning -1, as
 *     in the init phase) when the best score is no better than the average of
 *     the scores by more than 1e-9 relative, or when the same candidate has
 *     won PSYGP__REPEAT_MAX (3) trials in a row. psygp_next_subset() does
 *     not do this, because a Halton point is not in the subset. Measured on
 *     the semiparametric kernel with a level-set acquisition on the
 *     audiometric observer, where the second degeneracy was reliable: without
 *     the guard the threshold error froze at 23.4 dB, identical across all 20
 *     seeds, and the contour left the box in 14 of 30 context columns; with it,
 *     and with the priors above, the error falls to 8.1 dB pooled over the four
 *     phenotypes and no context column fails to cross.
 *
 *     EAVC WITH AN EMPTY LEVEL SET. When the expected number of candidates
 *     above the level is under one half or within one half of all of them,
 *     the model puts the level outside the box, every look-ahead moves the
 *     volume by almost nothing, and EAVC's argmax is noise (on the novel
 *     discrimination function it sampled the middle of the intensity range
 *     with every threshold in the bottom fifth). That trial is chosen by the
 *     LSE straddle instead, which walks toward the edge the level is past. On
 *     its own this took the columns without a crossing there from 21.9 to 12.2
 *     of 30; with the mean prior above it rarely engages.
 *
 *     THE LEVEL-SET GUARD (GP model, one-latent discrete likelihoods). A
 *     scheduled fit that reclassifies more than 5% of the candidates against
 *     the target, coming right after a fit that reclassified fewer than 2%,
 *     is undone, once: a fit proposed right after an undone one is accepted,
 *     so data that really demand the change get it one fit later. The
 *     failure it stops is a data-favored short-lengthscale mode: on the
 *     audiometric metabolic beta 0.5 observer a fit at trial 145 moved the
 *     lengthscales from (3.8 octaves, 41 dB) to (0.62, 7.5) at a log marginal
 *     likelihood 12 nats higher, interpolated the eleven sampled frequency
 *     columns, sent the unsampled ones to the mean, and took the threshold
 *     error from 2.0 to 37.8 dB. Neither a stronger prior nor a floor on the
 *     lengthscale stops that: the mean prior above holds the damage to 3.2 dB
 *     on the same trials, and a floor of one candidate spacing to 4.6, but
 *     the jump itself happens either way. The thresholds come from 1440
 *     scheduled fits of examples/gp_audiometric.c (20 replications, LSE,
 *     EAVC and BALV, metabolic and sensory at beta 2 and 0.5): after the
 *     first two fits the median fit reclassifies under 2% of the candidates;
 *     9 fits worsened the threshold by more than 3 dB, reclassifying 3 to
 *     25%; and the rule above undoes 19 fits, 8 of those 9, none of the fits
 *     that improved the threshold by more than 1 dB, and 113 dB of added error
 *     in all. On the comparison's own seeds, an independent check, it leaves
 *     every GP cell within its spread and the metabolic beta 0.5 LSE cell at
 *     1.89 dB (worst 3.74) against 4.09 (worst 37.8) before. It costs two
 *     candidate predictions per fit. It does not run under
 *     psygp_fit_step() called by the caller or the async layer's fit_in_idle,
 *     which have no before and after to compare.
 *
 *     What the guard does NOT do, in that one configuration: restore the run's
 *     dependence on the responses. Instrumented, SEMIP with LSE on the
 *     audiometric observer trips the repeat rule on every fourth trial for the
 *     whole session (145 trials, 35 fallbacks, and the flat test never fires),
 *     the acquisition returns to the same candidate immediately afterwards, and
 *     the candidate scores are bit-identical between two runs with different
 *     seeds. So the guard is a rate limiter there, worth 15 dB, and the run is
 *     still driven by the design rather than by the observer: the fit puts the
 *     intercept output scale at its ceiling, the latent variance swamps the
 *     responses, and the level-set score becomes a function of the candidate
 *     set alone. 8 dB of threshold error across 20 seeds takes only three
 *     distinct values for that reason. A fallback that proposes the best
 *     candidate NOT yet visited instead of a Halton point was measured and is
 *     not the answer: on one phenotype at beta = 2 it takes SEMIP with LSE from
 *     13.9 to 9.8 dB, but it takes SEMIP with BALV from 2.7 to 5.3 dB and RBF
 *     with LSE from 1.7 to 2.3, because a fallback that never repeats a
 *     candidate spends trials away from the threshold in the runs that were
 *     working. The repair for the SEMIP cell is in the model, not the
 *     acquisition: see SEMIP.
 *
 *   LOOK-AHEAD
 *     EAVC needs, for every candidate x*, the posterior at every other
 *     candidate AFTER one more observation at x*. With the
 *     Laplace Hessian W held at its current value, that posterior is the
 *     current one minus a rank-one term (the Woodbury identity on one new
 *     row), so the look-ahead latent variance at all M candidates for
 *     every one of the M candidates comes from the M x M posterior
 *     covariance among the candidates: O(M^2 N) to build it once per
 *     trial and O(M^2) per acquisition. The new observation enters the mean
 *     through one Newton step at the frozen W, and the outcome enters
 *     through its expectation, one quadrature per candidate. This is Letham
 *     et al.'s construction; the approximation is that W does not move on
 *     one trial, which is exactly the assumption the warm-started Newton
 *     step relies on anyway. Memory: the M x M covariance and the M x N
 *     solved kernel block it is built from, 4 MB together at M = N = 512.
 *     Only EAVC takes them; LOCALMI uses the variance at the candidate
 *     itself, which the ordinary prediction already gives.
 *     M is capped at 4096 under EAVC and 65536 otherwise.
 *     Two things make the M^2 scoring loop affordable. The level-set
 *     membership of a candidate is one normal cdf per candidate and outcome,
 *     and the loop uses a rational approximation of it (Abramowitz & Stegun
 *     26.2.17, 1e-7 absolute) rather than erfc, which costs 30 to 150 ns
 *     depending on the library and was most of a trial's time; predictions and
 *     thresholds are unaffected and still use erfc. And the sum runs over the
 *     CHANGE from the current volume, which lets it skip a candidate the new
 *     observation cannot move across the level. Together they took the scoring
 *     loop at M = 256 from 6 to 16 ms down to 3.5 to 3.9 ms, and a whole EAVC
 *     psygp_next() from 15 to 9 ms at N = 100 and from 101 to 28 ms at
 *     N = 400, measured as CPU time on one x86-64 desktop core under WSL2.
 *     What is left is the algorithm rather than the implementation: the M x M
 *     covariance costs M^2 N / 2 and the prediction M N^2 / 2, so halving M
 *     is what halves the first and quarters nothing else.
 *
 *   CANDIDATES (desc.candidates, desc.grid, desc.n_candidates,
 *   desc.refine_steps)
 *     desc.candidates: an explicit M x n_dims array the caller owns and
 *     must keep alive for the life of the handle, for the stimuli the
 *     display can actually produce. Else desc.grid[d]
 *     points per dimension for a product grid, last dimension fastest,
 *     endpoints included (every grid[d] must be at least 1 once one of them
 *     is set, except a CATEGORICAL dimension's, which is its level count; see
 *     DIMENSION KINDS under KERNELS). Else a Halton set of
 *     desc.n_candidates points (default 512). psygp_next_subset()
 *     restricts one trial to some of the candidates. The candidate set is
 *     also the set the look-ahead volume is measured on and the spacing
 *     psygp_threshold() scans with, so keep it fine enough along the
 *     intensity dimension.
 *     Finer is better, up to the cost. A coarse candidate set does act as a
 *     regularizer on a fit that has no prior, and on three replications of the
 *     audiometric observer it looked like a large one; on 20 replications with
 *     the weak priors of HYPERPARAMETERS in place the effect reverses, and the
 *     finer set wins: 1.46 +- 0.26 dB of threshold error at trial 150 on a
 *     15 x 25 grid against 1.98 +- 0.32 dB on 11 x 21, same seeds, same
 *     observer. Treat the candidate count as the cost knob it is, not as a
 *     way to regularize the model.
 *
 *     desc.refine_steps (default 0, off; at most 32) takes the grid winner off
 *     the grid. A proposal on a candidate set is quantized to it, and on the
 *     audiometric grid of 11 x 21 that is 7 dB along the intensity axis, where
 *     AEPsych optimizes the acquisition continuously. With refine_steps = n,
 *     psygp_next() runs n rounds of coordinate-wise golden-section search
 *     (10 iterations per dimension per round) on the acquisition, each
 *     dimension searched between the winner's two neighbors, one candidate
 *     spacing either side, clipped to the box; for a Halton or caller-owned
 *     set the spacing is what M points would have on a regular grid. The
 *     bracket stays on the winner's cell for every round, a round that moves
 *     nothing ends the search, and a move is taken only if it scores strictly
 *     higher, so the result never scores below the candidate it started from.
 *     A proposal that moved returns -1, like a Halton point.
 *     The objective is the acquisition at one point, which takes one
 *     prediction: exact for LSE, BALV, BALD and LOCALMI, whose candidate
 *     scores are that same arithmetic (the test checks the two agree to the
 *     last bit). EAVC is a sum over the OTHER candidates and has no value off
 *     the candidate set, so an EAVC winner is refined on the LSE straddle,
 *     which aims at the same level set: the look-ahead picks the cell and the
 *     straddle places the point inside it. RANDOM and psygp_next_subset() never
 *     refine. The cost is at most 1 + 12 n D predictions, 49 for n = 2 in two
 *     dimensions, each a kernel row and a triangular solve, which at M = 231
 *     is a fifth of the candidate sweep and inside the run-to-run noise of a
 *     whole trial.
 *     Measured with examples/gp_audiometric.c's protocol (metabolic phenotype,
 *     beta = 2, 20 replications, same seeds, trial 150):
 *
 *       refine_steps               0              2              4
 *       LSE   threshold, dB   1.98 +- 0.32   1.50 +- 0.13   1.53 +- 0.12
 *             field MAE(p)    0.077          0.089          0.085
 *             ms per trial    1.8            2.0            1.6
 *       EAVC  threshold, dB   1.98 +- 0.16   1.37 +- 0.15   1.38 +- 0.15
 *             field MAE(p)    0.058          0.073          0.073
 *             ms per trial    4.3            4.2            4.1
 *
 *     So refinement buys a quarter to a third of the threshold error and costs
 *     the field about as much: points placed exactly on the level set say more
 *     about the level set and less about everything else, and the early
 *     threshold is worse too (trial 25: 6.8 to 8.6 dB for LSE, 7.4 to 10.0 for
 *     EAVC). 4 rounds buy nothing over 2, because the search has almost always
 *     converged by then. The default stays 0, which keeps every earlier result
 *     reproducible; set 2 for a session whose deliverable is the threshold, and
 *     leave it 0 when it is the field.
 *
 *   THE LOOP
 *     psygp_next(g, x)             fills x[n_dims] with the next stimulus
 *     psygp_update(g, x, k)        what was shown, and the outcome; refits
 *     psygp_update_real(g, x, y)   the same under PSYGP_LIK_GAUSSIAN
 *     psygp_done(g)                a stop criterion has fired
 *     psygp_threshold(...)         level set along the intensity dimension
 *     psygp_predict_*(...)         the field and its uncertainty anywhere
 *     psygp_fit_step(g)            one step of a hyperparameter fit
 *     psygp_refit(g)               the exact refit desc.refit_every skips
 *
 *   next() and update() are separate, as in the other adaptive headers:
 *   show what you can, tell update() what you showed, at any point of the
 *   box, candidate or not. A proposal that has not been answered is handed
 *   out again by the next psygp_next(), and psygp_history() marks a trial
 *   `proposed` only when the stimulus given to update() is exactly the one
 *   proposed, so a display that quantized it leaves a record.
 *
 *   ESTIMATES
 *     psygp_predict_f(g, x, k, &mu, &sd)  latent k's mean and sd at x
 *                                         (k = 0 except CATEGORICAL). Under

 *                                         the threshold m and k = 1 the log
 *                                         slope g at x's context, and the
 *                                         intensity of x is ignored.
 *     psygp_predict_p(g, x)               the target quantity at x:
 *                                         E[P(y = 1)], E[P(y >= k*)] or
 *                                         E[P(y = k*)]; E[y] under
 *                                         GAUSSIAN. The probit Bernoulli
 *                                         case is closed-form,
 *                                         Phi(mu / sqrt(1 + sd^2)); the
 *                                         rest are quadrature.
 *     psygp_predict_p_many(g, xs, n, p)   the target quantity at n points, and
 *     psygp_predict_f_many(g, xs, n, k, mu, sd)
 *                                         latent k at n points. One blocked
 *                                         pass rather than n passes, which is
 *                                         what a field plot per trial needs.
 *                                         The saving is cache, not work: a
 *                                         point costs a kernel row and a
 *                                         triangular solve either way, so at
 *                                         N = 150 a 900-point field measured
 *                                         22 us per point one at a time and
 *                                         11 us per point batched, and the
 *                                         gap grows with N as the factor
 *                                         stops fitting in cache. A field on
 *                                         the CANDIDATE set is cheaper still,
 *                                         because the acquisition has already
 *                                         computed it.
 *     psygp_predict_outcomes(g, x, p)     all K outcome probabilities.
 *                                         Under CATEGORICAL these are K
 *                                         one-against-the-rest quadratures
 *                                         renormalized to sum to 1, not the
 *                                         exact K-dimensional softmax
 *                                         expectation.
 *     psygp_threshold(g, ctx, target, &x, &lo, &hi)
 *       Bisection along the intensity dimension at context ctx (the other
 *       n_dims - 1 coordinates, in order) for the level where
 *       psygp_predict_p() crosses target (0 = the desc's target). lo and hi
 *       are the crossings of the mu - 1.96 sd and mu + 1.96 sd latent
 *       curves, sorted, so a falling curve gives the same band as a rising
 *       one: a credible band from the latent posterior, not from posterior
 *       samples of the threshold. It is a 95% interval for the threshold
 *       only as far as the latent curve is straight over its width, and it
 *       is as wide as the latent posterior at the crossing divided by the
 *       slope there, so a loose fit shows up as a wide band.
 *       A band edge with no crossing inside the
 *       box is clamped to the box. Returns PSYGP_ERR_NOCROSS when the
 *       middle curve has no crossing inside the box, and
 *       psygp_threshold_multi_cross() reports when there was more than one
 *       (the non-monotone case), in which case the crossing at the lowest
 *       intensity is the one reported. The search scans the dimension
 *       before it bisects, at the candidate spacing (the grid count along
 *       that dimension, or M^(1/n_dims) clamped to 9..65 points), which is
 *       what lets it see a second crossing rather than bisect it away.
 *       Under PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC none of that: the threshold is the
 *       posterior mean of the crossing m + f_t exp(-g), f_t the latent level
 *       of the target (link^-1 of the target with the floor and ceiling taken
 *       off), which with (m, g) bivariate Gaussian is closed form,
 *         E = mm + f_t exp(-mg + vg / 2),
 *         Var = vm + f_t^2 (exp(-2 mg + 2 vg) - exp(-2 mg + vg))
 *               - 2 f_t cmg exp(-mg + vg / 2),
 *       and lo and hi are E -+ 1.96 sqrt(Var), clamped to the box. It is not
 *       where psygp_predict_p() crosses the target, which averages p over
 *       the posterior first; the two differ by the posterior's skew and agree
 *       as it narrows. PSYGP_ERR_NOCROSS when E falls outside the box, and
 *       psygp_threshold_multi_cross() is always false.
 *     psygp_argmax(g, x, &value)
 *       The stimulus with the highest posterior mean of the target quantity
 *       (lowest under desc.minimize): the best candidate, refined by
 *       desc.refine_steps on the same objective. The optimization
 *       counterpart of psygp_threshold(), for any acquisition.
 *     psygp_get_hyper(g, out) and psygp_log_marginal(g) for the fit.
 *
 *   STOPPING (desc.stop_trials, desc.stop_threshold_sd)
 *     stop_trials ends after that many trials. stop_threshold_sd ends when
 *     the width (hi - lo) of psygp_threshold() at desc.stop_context is
 *     below it; with n_dims = 1 the context is empty. At least one is
 *     required, and psygp_open() rejects a desc with neither.
 *     PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS (or desc.max_trials) is the hard ceiling.
 *     psygp_done() runs a threshold search every call while
 *     stop_threshold_sd is on, so call it once per trial, not in a poll.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   RETURN VALUES AND ERRORS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   psygp_open() returns bool and fills psygp_error(). Every other function
 *   returns a value or a code and never touches the message buffer.
 *   psygp_strerror() names a code.
 *
 *     PSYGP_ERR_ARG        null handle, x outside the box, outcome out of
 *                          range, update() under GAUSSIAN or
 *                          update_real() under a discrete likelihood
 *     PSYGP_ERR_CLOSED     the handle is not open
 *     PSYGP_ERR_FULL       max_trials recorded
 *     PSYGP_ERR_MEMORY     buffer too small or allocation failed (open)
 *     PSYGP_ERR_NOCROSS    no threshold inside the box at that context
 *     PSYGP_ERR_NUMERIC    a Cholesky failed; the trial is still recorded
 *                          and the posterior of the trials that did factor
 *                          stays in force, so predictions keep working from
 *                          one trial less. The next update tries again.
 *                          Happens with duplicate
 *                          stimuli at extreme outcomes and an output scale
 *                          fit too large; see desc.jitter.
 *
 *   psygp_next() is the exception to the code scheme: it returns a
 *   candidate index of 0 or more, -1 for a point that is not a candidate,
 *   and a code below -1 for a failure. PSYGP_ERR_ARG is -1 and therefore
 *   unusable there, so a null handle, a null x, a closed handle and a bad
 *   subset all come back as PSYGP_ERR_CLOSED, and a full handle as
 *   PSYGP_ERR_FULL.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MEMORY, COST AND THREADS
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   psygp_memory_size(desc) returns the bytes open() takes from
 *   desc.memory or from PSYGP_MALLOC (malloc by default; define
 *   PSYGP_MALLOC/PSYGP_FREE before the include), exactly once. With N =
 *   max_trials, M candidates and K latents (1 except CATEGORICAL):
 *   N*N*8 for the kernel matrix, K*N*N*8 for the Laplace factor, another
 *   N*N*8 of workspace for the hyperparameter gradient (taken whether or
 *   not desc.fit is on, because psygp_fit() is callable at any time), one
 *   more N*N*8 under CATEGORICAL for the coupling factor, the M x M
 *   look-ahead covariance and its M x N staging block under EAVC,
 *   a handful of N*8 vectors, M*n_dims*8 for a generated candidate set,
 *   and the history. PSYGP_MODEL_PSYCHOMETRIC adds a second N*N*8 prior
 *   matrix (the slope GP's), 18 N*8 vectors and M*40 bytes, and under EAVC
 *   2*M*N*8 for the look-ahead's columns and M*8, where the GP model's EAVC
 *   takes M*M*8 and M*N*8.
 *   Measured: Bernoulli at N = 512, M = 512 is 6.53 MB
 *   with LSE and 10.53 MB with EAVC; N = 200, M = 512 with LSE is 1.14 MB;
 *   a 3-class categorical at N = M = 512 with LSE is 12.63 MB; Bernoulli at
 *   N = 2048, M = 256 with LSE is 97.9 MB (MB here are 2^20 bytes). The
 *   history is in the block, N * 144 bytes, so the handle itself is 2904
 *   bytes on x86-64 whatever PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS is. Nothing allocates after
 *   open.
 *
 *   Per update: a Laplace refit warm-started from the last mode, typically
 *   2 to 4 Newton steps, each an N x N Cholesky (N^3 / 3 flops) plus two
 *   triangular solves; under CATEGORICAL a step is K such factorizations
 *   plus K triangular inversions and one more Cholesky for the coupling
 *   term, so about 2.5 K times the Bernoulli cost; none under
 *   GAUSSIAN, where the kernel Cholesky grows by one row per trial in
 *   O(N^2). A hyperparameter fit
 *   is up to desc.fit_max_evals (40) refits with gradients and is the
 *   expensive call: run it in the inter-trial interval one psygp_fit_step()
 *   at a time, or set fit_every to 0 and call psygp_fit() when you choose.
 *   On a large data set a converged fit is minutes: on 500 trials of the 6-D
 *   contrast sensitivity data (HYPERPARAMETERS), about 33 s for the GP model
 *   and 541 s for the psychometric model on the loaded machine that ran
 *   tests/compare/compare_gp_csfdata.py, and 6.9 s and about 200 s (updates
 *   included) for the same protocol on a quiet one. desc.fit_pcg (below)
 *   takes them to 3.4 s and 57 s. At PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS 1024 the GP model's
 *   block is about 25 MB, and an 800-trial fit costs about 4 times the
 *   500-trial one.
 *   Per trial in 6-D, the psychometric model with EAVC and 1000 candidates
 *   is about 4 s on a loaded machine: the look-ahead is M^2 N with M = 1000,
 *   and every one of the 1000 contexts takes its own bivariate quadrature.
 *   A 6-D session wants a few hundred candidates, a per-point acquisition
 *   (BALD, BALV, LSE) or the async layer, and usually two of the three.
 *
 *   desc.refit_every buys the update down to O(N^2). The exact Laplace
 *   factor cannot grow by a row, because the Hessian W changes in every
 *   entry with every trial; but if W is FROZEN at the values the last exact
 *   refit left, then adding a trial borders B with one row, its Cholesky
 *   gains one row by a triangular solve and a square root, and one
 *   quasi-Newton step moves the mode: five matrix-vector products in place
 *   of a factorization. That is the same rank-one construction the
 *   look-ahead acquisitions already use, applied to the training set.
 *   refit_every = k does that on every trial and an exact Newton refit
 *   every k trials; k larger than the session does no exact refit at all
 *   inside the loop, leaving psygp_refit() to the caller between blocks.
 *   The cost is drift: on a replayed 78-trial run, three cheap updates
 *   after the last exact refit put the posterior 1.7e-4 of probability
 *   away from the exact one, and psygp_refit() erases it. BERNOULLI and
 *   ORDINAL only; GAUSSIAN is already incremental and CATEGORICAL always
 *   refits.
 *
 *   desc.pcg_threshold keeps the update exact and makes its Newton steps
 *   O(N^2). Above that many trials (0 = 512, negative = never), an update's
 *   Newton steps solve B x = r by conjugate gradients instead of factoring
 *   B, preconditioned by the factor the previous update left, bordered by
 *   the new trial's row. At the first step that bordered factor is B's own,
 *   because the old sites' W has not moved yet; at the later steps it is
 *   close, and each solve takes a few iterations of one matrix-vector
 *   product and two triangular solves, 2 N^2 each, to a relative residual of
 *   1e-13. One factorization remains per update, at the end, for the
 *   predictive variances and the log determinant, where the factored path
 *   does one per Newton step; a solve that has not converged in 60
 *   iterations falls back to factoring. BERNOULLI, ORDINAL and PAIRWISE,
 *   the one-latent Laplace; a hyperparameter fit, CATEGORICAL, GAUSSIAN (no
 *   Newton) and the psychometric model factor as before, unless
 *   desc.fit_pcg (below) says otherwise. The result is the
 *   factored path's to the Newton tolerance, not to the bit: the test
 *   replays 200 trials both ways and finds the modes 4e-11 apart and the
 *   predictions 5e-12. The default of 512 is the default PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS,
 *   so a build that does not raise it never takes the path and every
 *   earlier result stands to the bit.

 *     256       9.3       3.2     3.5
 *     512      34        15      14

 *    2048    3858      1169    ~500
 *
 *   So the crossover is near N = 100, the gain grows to 2.6 times at
 *   N = 1024 and 3.3 at 2048, and it is capped there by the one
 *   factorization an exact update still needs (N^3 / 3: 360 M flops at
 *   1024, 2.9 G at 2048).
 *   Setting pcg_threshold to 100 buys 1.1 to 2.9 times between 128 and 512
 *   trials, at the price of results that match earlier versions to 1e-11
 *   instead of to the bit.
 *
 *   CONJUGATE GRADIENTS IN A FIT (desc.fit_pcg). What a fit evaluation
 *   factors, measured with gprof on fold 0 of the 6-D contrast sensitivity
 *   data (500 trials, the protocol of tests/compare/compare_gp_csfdata.py:
 *   stepped fits until a whole one moves the log marginal by < 1e-3 nats):
 *     GP model: 189 evaluations for 40 gradients, 136 fit steps. Every
 *     evaluation is a warm-started Newton search, 3.4 steps on average, each a
 *     Cholesky of B (635 in all, 58% of the time); a gradient adds B^-1
 *     explicitly for the trace terms (27%). A third of the evaluations are not
 *     search at all: a rejected line-search point is undone by refitting the
 *     old point from the rejected point's mode, and the gradient step after an
 *     accepted point refits the point it is already at.
 *     Psychometric model: the Gauss-Newton mode search converges linearly,
 *     about 27 steps a search, each a Cholesky of I + U' K U: 16514
 *     factorizations for 552 searches (500 updates and 52 evaluations), 90% of
 *     the time.
 *   Which solves can reuse a factor: every one. The hyperparameters move a
 *   little per line-search point and the Gauss-Newton U a little per step, so
 *   the factor the last evaluation or the last step left is a close
 *   preconditioner, and a conjugate-gradient solve with it takes about 7
 *   iterations of two matrix products and two triangular solves (a quarter of
 *   a factorization at N = 500, less below). What cannot be reused is the log
 *   determinant: the objective is log p(y | f) - 1/2 a'h - log|B|, and a line
 *   search accepts or rejects on it. Measured on the same fits, 54% (GP) and
 *   70% (psychometric) of the accept-or-reject decisions were within 1e-3
 *   nats, so an estimate of log|B| (stochastic Lanczos, Hutchinson) would
 *   have to be good to well under 1e-3 nats to leave them alone, which takes
 *   far more probe vectors than a factorization costs (not measured here),
 *   and would give up reproducibility besides; a factor reused for k
 *   evaluations gives no log|B| at the new point at all. So
 *   every evaluation still ends in one factorization, and fit_pcg removes the
 *   others:
 *     - the Newton or Gauss-Newton steps solve by preconditioned conjugate
 *       gradients (tolerance 1e-13), with one factorization at the end of the
 *       search for log|B|, the predictions and the gradient; a solve that
 *       takes 60 iterations falls back to factoring;
 *     - a rejected line-search point is undone by copying back the state the
 *       accepted point left (the factor, the mode vectors, the
 *       hyperparameters), held in a second N x N block;
 *     - the gradient step after an accepted point reuses the state that point
 *       left instead of refitting it;
 *     - the psychometric model's updates take the same conjugate-gradient mode
 *       search, preconditioned by the last trial's factor bordered by the new
 *       row.
 *   An inexact Newton variant (solve only to 1e-3 of the last step's size)
 *   cut the conjugate-gradient iterations by a third and was dropped: the
 *   modes it left were less accurate, the analytic gradient with them, and on
 *   ten audiogram sessions its psychometric fits stopped 0.38 nats lower on
 *   average.
 *   Measured (thread CPU time on an idle x86-64 core, gcc -O2, fold 0, the
 *   shorter of two runs; the fits reach the same point to the printed
 *   digits, 136 and 779 steps both ways, and the same held-out log loss):
 *
 *                           v0.13.1    v0.14.0    v0.14.0, fit_pcg
 *     GP model, fit          8.7 s      6.9 s      3.4 s
 *     psychometric, updates  32 s       32 s       14 s
 *     psychometric, fit      181 s      168 s      43 s
 *
 *   (v0.14.0 without the switch is faster because the explicit B^-1 now walks
 *   rows: 118 to 44 ms at N = 500, the same bits.) The factorizations fall
 *   from 635 to 101 (GP) and from 16514 to 555 (psychometric). On the
 *   audiogram's box at N = 150 (an LSE session replayed into each
 *   configuration, ten seeds) the GP fit goes from 0.25 to 0.16 s, to the
 *   same log marginal, and the psychometric fit from 3.2 to 2.3 s, to log
 *   marginal -68.503 against -68.500 and threshold error 1.318 against 1.314
 *   dB: the two paths agree to the Newton tolerance at every evaluation, and
 *   on the psychometric model's flat ridge of lengthscales that is enough to
 *   end a fit at a different point of the ridge. That is also why fit_pcg is
 *   off by default: the default path keeps every earlier result to the bit.
 *   The test runs the two paths in lockstep, one fit step at a time, under
 *   BERNOULLI, ORDINAL, PAIRWISE and the psychometric model, and finds them
 *   at the same point after every step to 2e-9. Memory: another N x N block
 *   and 23 N-vectors, 2.2 MB at N = 512. GAUSSIAN (no Newton step) and
 *   CATEGORICAL ignore the switch.
 *
 *   Per next: M candidates, each a kernel row (N) and a triangular solve
 *   (N^2 / 2), so M*N^2/2 flops: 256 candidates at N = 200 is 5 M, at
 *   N = 400 20 M; EAVC adds M^2 N / 2 once and M^2 per candidate and
 *   outcome. Predictions are computed in blocks of 32 candidates so the
 *   factor is read once per block rather than once per candidate.
 *
 *   FRAME BUDGET
 *   A trial's psygp_next() plus psygp_update() should fit in one display
 *   frame, 16 ms, so an experiment can call them between trials with no
 *   thread and no pacing. examples/gp_bench.c measures exactly that and
 *   prints the largest trial count that stays inside it. Measured on v0.14.0
 *   on one x86-64 laptop core (an i7-1360P under WSL2, load average under 1),
 *   gcc 11.4 -O2, Bernoulli probit RBF over a 2-D box with M = 256
 *   candidates, next + update, median of a ten-trial window, in ms:
 *
 *     N     LSE      LSE no      EAVC     EAVC no
 *           exact    refit       exact    refit
 *     50     0.34     0.24        3.2      3.3
 *     100    1.2      0.70        4.8      4.5
 *     200    4.9      2.4         9.1      7.7
 *     400   21.1      8.6        30.0     15.0
 *
 *   and the largest N whose next + update still fits the frame, from that
 *   run and a second one a minute later:
 *
 *     LSE, exact refit every trial      347 and 348
 *     LSE, no refit inside the loop     past 400
 *     EAVC, exact refit every trial     285 and 299
 *     EAVC, no refit inside the loop    past 400
 *
 *   Past 400 trials the frame is gone for an exact update whatever the
 *   solver: with conjugate-gradient Newton steps (desc.pcg_threshold) an
 *   update is 15 ms at N = 512, 130 ms at 1024 and 1.2 s at 2048, and
 *   psygp_next() at M = 256 adds 14, 75 and about 500 ms (it is M N^2 / 2).
 *   A session that long takes its trials from another thread (PSYGP_ASYNC,
 *   where a proposal is late by the update's cost in frames, 8 frames at
 *   N = 1024), or runs desc.refit_every with an exact refit between blocks,
 *   or both; a larger PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS changes the memory, not the frame
 *   arithmetic.
 *
 *   A hyperparameter fit does not fit a frame at any useful N, which is what
 *   psygp_fit_step() is for: on the same machine at N = 400 one step is 28 to
 *   37 ms and a whole fit is 40 steps, 1.0 to 1.2 s, so a fit spread one step
 *   to a trial costs a session 40 trials of latency instead of one trial of
 *   a second.
 *
 *   ("no refit" is refit_every past the session length.) Read those as an
 *   order of magnitude, not as a specification: the run-to-run spread is tens
 *   of percent even quiet, the largest-N figures moved between 180 and 380 over
 *   runs of the same binary on a loaded machine (v0.1, an x86-64 desktop),
 *   and anything else running inflates all of them. Measure your own
 *   configuration with gp_bench.
 *
 *   What to do when
 *   a configuration does not fit: fewer candidates (next is linear in M,
 *   and EAVC is quadratic), a cheaper acquisition (LSE and LOCALMI need no
 *   M x M covariance), desc.refit_every with psygp_refit() between blocks,
 *   psygp_fit_step() instead of psygp_fit() so the fit is spread over
 *   trials, a lower max_trials, or another thread: PSYGP_ASYNC is that thread,
 *   written and tested, and ASYNC says what it does and does not buy. A handle
 *   is not thread-safe, and nothing in the header is for the frame loop
 *   itself: these calls belong between trials.
 *
 *   Every function is deterministic unless desc.rng is set: the same desc
 *   and the same history give the same posterior, the same proposals and
 *   the same fit. A saved history replayed through psygp_update()
 *   restores a run, except that the fit schedule is by trial count, so
 *   replay with the same fit_every, and a stepped fit's progress is not in
 *   the history. A snapshot (SNAPSHOTS) restores it without the replay.
 *
 *   SNAPSHOTS (psygp_save_size, psygp_save, psygp_load)
 *     psygp_save() writes psygp_save_size(g) bytes; psygp_load() opens a
 *     handle from them and a desc that re-supplies what a snapshot cannot
 *     carry (the pointers: rng and rng_ctx, candidates, memory), checks the
 *     desc's numbers against the saved ones, and the session continues where
 *     it was cut, a pending proposal included, with no refit and no replay:
 *     the next proposal, the next update and every estimate are the
 *     uninterrupted session's to the bit. The generator's state is the
 *     caller's: save it beside the snapshot and put it back before the next
 *     call. The test cuts sessions under eleven configurations (GP LSE with
 *     refinement, GP EAVC, the psychometric model with BALD and EAVC,
 *     CATEGORICAL, ORDINAL with refit_every, GAUSSIAN UCB, PAIRWISE
 *     Thompson, and mixed kinds with a monotone projection and conjugate-
 *     gradient updates, and GP LSE and the psychometric model with
 *     desc.fit_pcg) at six trials each, before and after the proposal,
 *     a stepped fit in progress, and loads into a handle filled with
 *     garbage: all 132 resumed sessions match the uninterrupted ones in every
 *     proposal and in their final snapshots, byte for byte.
 *     SNAPSHOT LAYOUT, format 1. Every integer is little-endian two's
 *     complement, written and read byte by byte, so a snapshot moves between
 *     compilers and platforms of the same PSYGP_REAL; an f64 is the IEEE 754
 *     bit pattern as a u64, and a psygp_real is its own bit pattern (8 bytes,
 *     or 4 in a float build).
 *       magic     4 bytes "PSGP", then u32 format (1), u8 sizeof(psygp_real)

 *                 sqrt(W) (N each) and the factor's lower triangle; the
 *                 kernel matrix's lower triangle; under the psychometric
 *                 model the slope GP's kernel matrix and the 18 site vectors

 *       fit_pcg   only when desc.fit_pcg applies: i32 the count of the last

 *                 when set f64 its objective and log marginal, its
 *                 hyperparameters, its factor's lower triangle and its
 *                 23 N-vectors
 *     The candidate cache is not saved; it is a function of the rest and the

 *     about 200 KB at N = 150 and 2.1 MB at N = 512.
 *     psygp_load() compares the desc section with the desc it is given and
 *     names the first field that differs, range-checks the counters, and
 *     fails a wrong, truncated or corrupt snapshot with a message and the
 *     handle closed. Nothing but the bytes is checked: a snapshot edited to
 *     hold other finite numbers loads, and the session continues from them.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   SIMULATION
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   psygp_simulate_outcome(p, K, u) draws an outcome from K probabilities
 *   with the uniform variate u in [0, 1) that the caller supplies; K = 2
 *   with p = {1 - p1, p1} is the Bernoulli case. The header draws nothing
 *   itself; desc.rng is the caller's generator lent to the header for the
 *   two places randomness helps (ties, random acquisition). examples/gp_sim.c
 *   runs the LSE, EAVC and BALV configurations against a 2-D observer with
 *   a known threshold curve and prints the error of psygp_threshold() per
 *   trial. tests/compare/compare_gp_aepsych.py runs the comparison with
 *   AEPsych on the same kind of observer, through the Python binding, in one
 *   process, on one response stream; STATUS has its result.
 *   tests/adapt/psy_gp_test.c is the self-checking test the STATUS block
 *   quotes; examples/gp_bench.c is where the cost numbers come from.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   PRECISION (PSYGP_REAL)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   The matrices that dominate the cost and the memory hold psygp_real,
 *   which is double unless PSYGP_REAL says otherwise: the kernel matrix, the
 *   Laplace factors, the hyperparameter gradient's workspace and the
 *   look-ahead covariance. Every vector, every accumulation and every scalar
 *   is double in both builds, the dot products accumulate in double, and the
 *   Newton tolerance, the smallest accepted fit step and the default jitter
 *   move with the working precision (1e-11, 1e-9 and 1e-6 in double;
 *   1e-5, 1e-5 and 1e-4 in float; a Newton step in float cannot resolve a
 *   mode better than about 1e-5 of the latent, and asking for more only runs
 *   the iteration to its cap).
 *
 *   -DPSYGP_REAL=float halves those matrices: 10.44 MB becomes 5.44 MB for
 *   Bernoulli at N = M = 512 with EAVC. What it costs, measured by
 *   tests/adapt/psy_gp_test.c, which prints the worst error it saw in either
 *   build (double, then float): Cholesky and triangular inverse 6e-17 and
 *   5e-7, the Laplace stationarity residual 3e-16 and 9e-5, the predictive
 *   variance against a dense (K^-1 + W)^-1 9e-16 and 2e-5, the Laplace log
 *   marginal likelihood 0 and 1e-5, the rank-one look-ahead covariance 2e-12
 *   and 9e-6, the analytic hyperparameter gradient against central
 *   differences 9e-5 and 2.9e-2 relative (and the difference step has to grow
 *   from 1e-5 to 3e-3, because a float objective is only good to about 1e-7).
 *   The same holds for the fits whose gradient IS central differences
 *   (CATEGORICAL): their step is 1e-4 of the hyperparameter in double and
 *   3e-3 in float. In float the psychometric model's mode is good to about
 *   4e-4 of the latent, which is what its analytic gradient is then good to
 *   as well.
 *   psygp_refit() restores the exact posterior to 6e-15 in double and 6e-8 in
 *   float.
 *   What it does not cost: the answers an experiment reads. Over 20 response
 *   streams of a 100-trial simulated observer the mean absolute threshold
 *   error is 0.0130 against 0.0134 for LSE, 0.0128 against 0.0139 for EAVC
 *   and 0.0323 against 0.0429 for BALD, and neither build reported a single
 *   PSYGP_ERR_NUMERIC in 6000 updates.
 *
 *   What float does NOT buy is time. The same 6000 updates took 42.3 s in
 *   double and 41.0 s in float, three percent; and per phase, measured as CPU
 *   time at M = 256 (candidate prediction, covariance build, scoring loop and
 *   one Laplace refit, ms), double against float:
 *
 *     N = 50    0.5 2.4 3.4 0.04   against   0.6 3.1 3.8 0.05
 *     N = 100   0.9 2.6 2.6 0.14   against   1.6 7.4 8.1 0.29
 *     N = 200   4.0 7.3 3.5 1.02   against   4.8 10.3 3.0 1.48
 *     N = 400  19.3 32.9 3.8 9.0   against  19.1 34.4 3.7 14.5
 *
 *   which is a wash or slightly worse. The reason is that every loop here is
 *   scalar at -O2, so a float multiply costs exactly what a double multiply
 *   costs, and the matrices still reach the same cache level. Float would pay
 *   where the loops vectorize or where the working set crosses a cache
 *   boundary; measure it with examples/gp_bench.c before believing in it.
 *
 *   PSYGP_LIK_GAUSSIAN is not available in a float build and psygp_open()
 *   says so: its exact posterior factors the raw kernel matrix rather than
 *   I + W^1/2 K W^1/2, and that matrix is too ill-conditioned for float.
 *   Double remains the default on those numbers.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   ASYNC (PSYGP_ASYNC)
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Everything above runs on the thread that calls it, and FRAME BUDGET says
 *   what that costs: some configurations fit a 16 ms frame and the interesting
 *   ones do not. A look-ahead acquisition at a few hundred trials is tens of
 *   milliseconds and a hyperparameter fit is hundreds, so the knobs there
 *   (fewer candidates, a cheaper acquisition, refit_every, fit_step) all trade
 *   something away to buy the frame back. The other answer is to not do the
 *   work on the frame loop's thread at all. Define PSYGP_ASYNC before the
 *   include and this header gains one:
 *
 *       #define PSYGP_ASYNC
 *       #define PSY_GP_IMPLEMENTATION
 *       #include "psy_gp.h"             // brings psy_rt.h with it
 *
 *       psygp_gp g;
 *       psygp_open(&g, &desc);          // as usual, on this thread
 *       psygp_async a;
 *       psygp_async_desc ad = {
 *           .gp           = &g,
 *           .context      = { 0.5 },    // where the snapshot's threshold is
 *           .fit_in_idle  = true,       // the fit lives in the gaps
 *           .below_normal = true,       // never above the frame loop
 *       };
 *       if (!psygp_async_start(&a, &ad)) die(psygp_async_error(&a));
 *
 *       psygp_snapshot s;
 *       psygp_async_poll(&a, &s);       // the first proposal, already there
 *       for (;;) {
 *           int k   = run_trial(s.x);             // your frames
 *           int seq = psygp_async_submit(&a, s.x, k);
 *           while (drawing_frames())              // the interval
 *               if (psygp_async_poll(&a, &s) >= seq) break;
 *           if (s.done) break;
 *       }
 *       psygp_async_stop(&a);           // drains; the handle is yours again
 *
 *   WHAT IT IS. psy_rt.h's psyrt_pump with psygp_update(), psygp_next() and
 *   psygp_threshold() in its on_msg: one thread, a queue of PSYGP_ASYNC_QUEUE
 *   responses (8 by default) inline in the handle, no heap, normal or
 *   below-normal priority and never above it. Read psy_rt.h's PUMP section for
 *   the queue, the seq and the lock; this layer is a few hundred lines on top
 *   of it and adds no concurrency of its own. psy_quest.h's PSYQ_ASYNC is the
 *   same layer over QUEST+ and reads the same.
 *
 *   THE FIT IN THE GAPS is what the GP has that QUEST+ does not.
 *   desc.fit_in_idle puts one psygp_fit_step() in the pump's on_idle, which
 *   runs whenever the response queue is empty, and takes over from
 *   desc.fit_every, which the layer parks at 0 for the duration and restores at
 *   stop(). The effect is that the hyperparameters keep improving between
 *   trials and cost the trial loop nothing, and that a response never waits
 *   behind a whole fit: on_idle returns after one evaluation, the queue is
 *   checked, and the response goes first. A snapshot published from an idle
 *   step carries the same seq as the last response with new hypers, a new log
 *   marginal and `fitting` still true; it does not move the proposal, which
 *   belongs to the responses. Leave fit_in_idle off and desc.fit_every is
 *   honored as usual, on the pump thread, which is then one slow trial in
 *   every fit_every rather than a spread cost.
 *
 *   OWNERSHIP, which is the rule to get right. The caller opens the gp handle
 *   and psygp_async_start() takes it over: from then until psygp_async_stop()
 *   returns, NO psygp_* call on that handle is allowed from any thread,
 *   including the const ones (psygp_predict_p() writes the handle's prediction
 *   scratch, so even a read of the posterior is a write). Everything a trial
 *   loop needs is in the snapshot instead: the proposal, the trial count, the
 *   stop flags, the threshold with its band, the hyperparameters, the log
 *   marginal likelihood and how many updates have returned PSYGP_ERR_NUMERIC.
 *   After stop the handle is the caller's again and every psygp_* call is
 *   legal, which is how a session ends: stop, then read the history, the
 *   posterior, the field and the estimates at leisure.
 *
 *   THE SEQ. psygp_async_submit() returns a positive, increasing seq for the
 *   response it copied. psygp_async_poll() returns the seq the snapshot
 *   accounts for: every response through it has been applied AND the proposal
 *   in the snapshot was computed after them. So `poll() >= seq` is the "is the
 *   next stimulus ready?" test, it is one atomic load and a struct copy, and a
 *   frame loop can afford it every frame. psygp_async_wait() is the blocking
 *   form with a relative timeout, for the end of an interval.
 *
 *   Seq 0 is the proposal psygp_async_start() computed before the thread
 *   existed, so a snapshot always exists once start() has returned true and the
 *   first trial reads its stimulus from a poll that returns 0. That is why
 *   there is no "nothing published yet" state to handle.
 *
 *   A FULL QUEUE is PSYGP_ERR_BUSY, nothing was copied, and the caller still
 *   owns the response: retry it on the next frame, which examples/gp_async.c
 *   does. A queue that grew instead would trade a visible error for an
 *   invisible unbounded latency. With the default queue of 8 it takes eight
 *   trials submitted faster than the thread drains to get there.
 *
 *   WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not make a slow configuration fast, it moves
 *   it: a proposal that takes four frames still takes four frames, and what the
 *   loop gains is that it is drawing during them instead of blocked. The cost
 *   of being late is one more frame of the same stimulus, which an experiment
 *   has to be written for; examples/gp_async.c counts how often it happened.
 *   It does not touch determinism either: the thread runs the same functions in
 *   submit order, so the same responses give the same posterior bit for bit
 *   whether they went through the queue or not, and
 *   tests/adapt/psy_gp_test.c checks exactly that with memcmp. (With
 *   fit_in_idle on the fit sees a different schedule, so the posterior is a
 *   different one, reproducible only for the same timing. Bit-for-bit replay of
 *   an async session means replaying the history through psygp_update() with
 *   fit_in_idle off.)
 *
 *   COST. The handle is 6240 bytes on x86-64 at the default ceilings: mostly
 *   psyrt_pump's inline ring, which this layer does not use
 *   (PSYRT_PUMP_INLINE_BYTES can be set to 1 if nothing else in the program
 *   needs it), plus 80 bytes a queued response and a 440-byte snapshot.
 *   A submit is a mutex, an 80-byte copy and a condition-variable signal. A
 *   poll is an atomic load and a 440-byte copy under a lock nothing else holds
 *   for long. Nothing allocates, at start or after.
 *
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   BUILDING
 *   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   Nothing to link but libm, unless PSYGP_ASYNC is defined: then psy_gp.h
 *   includes psy_rt.h, which must sit beside it, and POSIX builds link
 *   -pthread. Copy both headers in that case, as a transport header's user
 *   does. PSY_GP_IMPLEMENTATION then also compiles psy_rt.h's implementation,
 *   unless the same translation unit already defined PSY_RT_IMPLEMENTATION or
 *   implemented a transport header; either order gives exactly one copy.
 *   PSYGP_ASYNC together with PSYRT_NO_THREADS is a #error: the layer IS a
 *   thread, so there is nothing sensible to compile.
 *
 *   Define PSYGP_API to override the default
 *   `extern` linkage (definitions too, so static works). Define
 *   PSYGP_MAX_DIMS (8), PSYGP_MAX_OUTCOMES (8), PSYGP_MAX_TRIALS (512),
 *   PSYGP_REAL (double) and PSYGP_ASYNC_QUEUE (8, the response queue, which
 *   sizes the psygp_async handle)
 *   before the include to resize the handle and the ceilings; define them the
 *   same in every translation unit. Every matrix
 *   is row-major and dense, every loop is scalar: there is no BLAS and no
 *   thread, so -O2 and a compiler that vectorizes a dot product are the
 *   whole performance story.
