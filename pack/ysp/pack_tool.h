/* ysp/pack_tool.h - v0.2.0 - the pack tool as a library (prefix ypt_)
 *
 *   Builds, verifies, lists, extracts, rebuilds and appends ysp packs
 *   (docs/pack.md). The CLI `ypak` (pack/ypak.c) is a thin layer over these
 *   calls, and the designer runs the same code as WebAssembly. Not a single
 *   header: a C11 library in the pack tool's tree that links ysp/pack.h,
 *   ysp/json.h (every description and manifest), ysp/table.h,
 *   ysp/outline.h, ysp/gfx.h (CPU parts: the shader wrapper and the curve
 *   set check), ysp/color.h, ysp/audio.h (the WAV probe), pack/layout
 *   (Skribidi, for glyph runs) and lodepng (PNG). The library compiles
 *   those headers' implementations itself (pack/pack_impl.c): a program
 *   that links it does not define YSP_PACK_IMPLEMENTATION,
 *   YSP_JSON_IMPLEMENTATION, YSP_TABLE_IMPLEMENTATION,
 *   YSP_OUTLINE_IMPLEMENTATION, YSP_GFX_IMPLEMENTATION or
 *   YSP_AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION again.
 *
 *   v0.1.1 (2026-10-09): the JSON reader and writer moved to ysp/json.h,
 *   the repository's one strict reader. Every pack of the test corpus is
 *   byte-identical to v0.1.0's but for the manifest, which now names
 *   ysp/json.h among the libraries.
 *
 *   v0.2.0 (2026-10-09): a TEXTURE entry's encoding bytes are what
 *   ygfx_texture() takes (ysp/gfx.h v0.10.5), so the documented load path
 *   works: "linear" stores all 0; "device" and "srgb" store primaries
 *   DEVICE, except sRGB codes in RGB, which need "primaries": "bt709" or
 *   "device" in the description (refused without); r16ui is linear only.
 *   Texture entries and the chunk list differ from v0.1.1's; so does a
 *   SHADER entry, which records YGFX_SHADER_CONTRACT 2.
 *
 *   Every call returns 0 or a negative code (ysp/pack.h's YPAK_ERR_*
 *   values) and writes one line into err: what failed, where, and what to
 *   do. Reports (verify, rebuild, list) go to the FILE* given; NULL is
 *   quiet. Nothing here keeps state between calls.
 *
 *   Determinism: the same source description, sources and tool version give
 *   the same bytes (docs/pack.md 7). The manifest records the tool and
 *   library versions but not the compiler, so packs from different builds
 *   of one version have one pack ID when their entries agree.
